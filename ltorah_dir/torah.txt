GENESIS
I. THE PRIMEVAL HISTORY
Gen. 1
First Story of Creation. 1 In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, 2
the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept
over the waters.
3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw how good the light
was. God then separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the
darkness he called “night.” Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day.
6 Then God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters, to separate one body of
water from the other.” And so it happened: 7 God made the dome, and it separated the water
above the dome from the water below it. 8 God called the dome “the sky.” Evening came, and
morning followed—the second day.
9 Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into a single basin, so that the dry
land may appear.” And so it happened: the water under the sky was gathered into its basin, and
the dry land appeared. 10 God called the dry land “the earth,” and the basin of the water he
called “the sea.” God saw how good it was. 11 Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth
vegetation: every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit
with its seed in it.” And so it happened: 12 the earth brought forth every kind of plant that bears
seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it. God saw how good it
was. 13 Evening came, and morning followed—the third day.
14 Then God said: “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky, to separate day from night.
Let them mark the fixed times, the days and the years, 15 and serve as luminaries in the dome of
the sky, to shed light upon the earth.” And so it happened: 16 God made the two great lights, the
greater one to govern the day, and the lesser one to govern the night; and he made the stars. 17
God set them in the dome of the sky, to shed light upon the earth, 18 to govern the day and the
night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw how good it was. 19 Evening came,
and morning followed—the fourth day.
20 Then God said, “Let the water teem with an abundance of living creatures, and on the
earth let birds fly beneath the dome of the sky.” And so it happened: 21 God created the great sea
monsters and all kinds of swimming creatures with which the water teems, and all kinds of
winged birds. God saw how good it was, 22 and God blessed them, saying, “Be fertile, multiply,
and fill the water of the seas; and let the birds multiply on the earth.” 23 Evening came, and
morning followed—the fifth day.
24 Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures: cattle, creeping
things, and wild animals of all kinds.” And so it happened: 25 God made all kinds of wild
animals, all kinds of cattle, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. God saw how good it
was. 26 Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the cattle, and over all the wild animals
and all the creatures that crawl on the ground.” 27 God created man in his image; in the divine
image he created him; male and female he created them. 28 God blessed them, saying: “Be
fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds
of the air, and all the living things that move on the earth.” 29 God also said: “See, I give you
every seed-bearing plant all over the earth and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit on it to be
your food; 30 and to all the animals of the land, all the birds of the air, and all the living creatures
that crawl on the ground, I give all the green plants for food.” And so it happened. 31 God
looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good. Evening came, and morning
followed—the sixth day.

Gen. 2
1 Thus the heavens and the earth and all their array were completed. 2 Since on the seventh
day God was finished with the work he had been doing, he rested on the seventh day from all the
work he had undertaken. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he
rested from all the work he had done in creation.
4 Such is the story of the heavens and the earth at their creation. At the time when the
LORD God made the earth and the heavens—
Second Story of Creation. 5 while as yet there was no field shrub on earth and no grass of
the field had sprouted, for the LORD God had sent no rain upon the earth and there was no man
to till the soil, 6 but a stream was welling up out of the earth and was watering all the surface of
the ground— 7 the LORD God formed man out of the clay of the ground and blew into his
nostrils the breath of life, and so man became a living being.
8 Then the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and he placed there the man
whom he had formed. 9 Out of the ground the LORD God made various trees grow that were
delightful to look at and good for food, with the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the
tree of the knowledge of good and bad.
10 A river rises in Eden to water the garden; beyond there it divides and becomes four
branches. 11 The name of the first is the Pishon; it is the one that winds through the whole land
of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 The gold of that land is excellent; bdellium and lapis lazuli
are also there. 13 The name of the second river is the Gihon; it is the one that winds all through
the land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is the Tigris; it is the one that flows east of
Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
15 The LORD God then took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden, to cultivate and
care for it. 16 The LORD God gave man this order: “You are free to eat from any of the trees of
the garden 17 except the tree of knowledge of good and bad. From that tree you shall not eat; the
moment you eat from it you are surely doomed to die.”
18 The LORD God said: “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a suitable
partner for him.” 19 So the LORD God formed out of the ground various wild animals and
various birds of the air, and he brought them to the man to see what he would call them;
whatever the man called each of them would be its name. 20 The man gave names to all the
cattle, all the birds of the air, and all the wild animals; but none proved to be the suitable partner
for the man.
21 So the LORD God cast a deep sleep on the man, and while he was asleep, he took out
one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. 22 The LORD God then built up into a woman
the rib that he had taken from the man. When he brought her to the man, 23 the man said: “This
one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; This one shall be called ‘woman,’ for out
of ‘her man’ this one has been taken.” 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and
clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body.
25 The man and his wife were both naked, yet they felt no shame.
Gen. 3
The Fall of Man. 1 Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the animals that the
LORD God had made. The serpent asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat from
any of the trees in the garden?” 2 The woman answered the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of
the trees in the garden; 3 it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God
said, ‘You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.’” 4 But the serpent said to the woman:
“You certainly will not die! 5 No, God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will
be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad.” 6 The woman saw
that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she
took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and
Books of Moses

4

he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked;
so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
8 When they heard the sound of the LORD God moving about in the garden at the breezy
time of the day, the man and his wife hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the
garden. 9 The LORD God then called to the man and asked him, “Where are you?” 10 He
answered, “I heard you in the garden; but I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.” 11
Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? You have eaten, then, from the tree of
which I had forbidden you to eat!” 12 The man replied, “The woman whom you put here with
me—she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate it.” 13 The LORD God then asked the woman,
“Why did you do such a thing?” The woman answered, “The serpent tricked me into it, so I ate
it.”
14 Then the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you shall be
banned from all the animals and from all the wild creatures; On your belly shall you crawl, and
dirt shall you eat all the days of your life. 15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
between your offspring and hers; He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel.”
16 To the woman he said: “I will intensify the pangs of your childbearing; in pain shall you
bring forth children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall be your master.”
17 To the man he said: “Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree of which I
had forbidden you to eat, “Cursed be the ground because of you! In toil shall you eat its yield all
the days of your life. 18 Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you, as you eat of the plants of
the field. 19 By the sweat of your face shall you get bread to eat, Until you return to the ground,
from which you were taken; For you are dirt, and to dirt you shall return.” 20 The man called his
wife Eve, because she became the mother of all the living.
21 For the man and his wife the LORD God made leather garments, with which he clothed
them. 22 Then the LORD God said: “See! The man has become like one of us, knowing what is
good and what is bad! Therefore, he must not be allowed to put out his hand to take fruit from
the tree of life also, and thus eat of it and live forever.” 23 The LORD God therefore banished
him from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he had been taken. 24 When he
expelled the man, he settled him east of the garden of Eden; and he stationed the cherubim and
the fiery revolving sword, to guard the way to the tree of life.
Gen. 4
Cain and Abel. 1 The man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore
Cain, saying, “I have produced a man with the help of the LORD.” 2 Next she bore his brother
Abel. Abel became a keeper of flocks, and Cain a tiller of the soil. 3 In the course of time Cain
brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit of the soil, 4 while Abel, for his part, brought one
of the best firstlings of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 5 but on
Cain and his offering he did not. Cain greatly resented this and was crestfallen. 6 So the LORD
said to Cain: “Why are you so resentful and crestfallen? 7 If you do well, you can hold up your
head; but if not, sin is a demon lurking at the door: his urge is toward you, yet you can be his
master.”
8 Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out in the field.” When they were in the field,
Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. 9 Then the LORD asked Cain, “Where is your
brother Abel?” He answered, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 10 The LORD then
said: “What have you done! Listen: your brother’s blood cries out to me from the soil! 11
Therefore you shall be banned from the soil that opened its mouth to receive your brother’s
blood from your hand. 12 If you till the soil, it shall no longer give you its produce. You shall
become a restless wanderer on the earth.” 13 Cain said to the LORD: “My punishment is too
great to bear. 14 Since you have now banished me from the soil, and I must avoid your presence
and become a restless wanderer on the earth, anyone may kill me at sight.” 15 “Not so!” the
Books of Moses

5

LORD said to him. “If anyone kills Cain, Cain shall be avenged sevenfold.” So the LORD put a
mark on Cain, lest anyone should kill him at sight. 16 Cain then left the LORD’S presence and
settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
Descendants of Cain and Seth. 17 Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and
bore Enoch. Cain also became the founder of a city, which he named after his son Enoch. 18 To
Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael; Mehujael became the father of
Methusael, and Methusael became the father of Lamech. 19 Lamech took two wives; the name
of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah. 20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, the
ancestor of all who dwell in tents and keep cattle. 21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the
ancestor of all who play the lyre and the pipe. 22 Zillah, on her part, gave birth to Tubalcain, the
ancestor of all who forge instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
23 Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my
utterance: I have killed a man for wounding me, a boy for bruising me. 24 If Cain is avenged
sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
25 Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son whom she called
Seth. “God has granted me more offspring in place of Abel,” she said, “because Cain slew him.”
26 To Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh.
At that time men began to invoke the LORD by name.
Gen. 5
Generations Adam to Noah. 1 This is the record of the descendants of Adam. When God
created man, he made him in the likeness of God; 2 he created them male and female. When they
were created, he blessed them and named them “man.”
3 Adam was one hundred and thirty years old when he begot a son in his likeness, after his
image; and he named him Seth. 4 Adam lived eight hundred years after the birth of Seth, and he
had other sons and daughters. 5 The whole lifetime of Adam was nine hundred and thirty years;
then he died.
6 When Seth was one hundred and five years old, he became the father of Enosh. 7 Seth
lived eight hundred and seven years after the birth of Enosh, and he had other sons and
daughters. 8 The whole lifetime of Seth was nine hundred and twelve years; then he died.
9 When Enosh was ninety years old, he became the father of Kenan. 10 Enosh lived eight
hundred and fifteen years after the birth of Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters. 11 The
whole lifetime of Enosh was nine hundred and five years; then he died.
12 When Kenan was seventy years old, he became the father of Mahalalel. 13 Kenan lived
eight hundred and forty years after the birth of Mahalalel, and he had other sons and daughters.
14 The whole lifetime of Kenan was nine hundred and ten years; then he died.
15 When Mahalalel was sixty-five years old, he became the father of Jared. 16 Mahalalel
lived eight hundred and thirty years after the birth of Jared, and he had other sons and daughters.
17 The whole lifetime of Mahalalel was eight hundred and ninety-five years; then he died.
18 When Jared was one hundred and sixty-two years old, he became the father of Enoch. 19
Jared lived eight hundred years after the birth of Enoch, and he had other sons and daughters. 20
The whole lifetime of Jared was nine hundred and sixty-two years; then he died.
21 When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 Enoch
lived three hundred years after the birth of Methuselah, and he had other sons and daughters. 23
The whole lifetime of Enoch was three hundred and sixty-five years. 24 Then Enoch walked with
God, and he was no longer here, for God took him.
25 When Methuselah was one hundred and eighty-seven years old, he became the father of
Lamech. 26 Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after the birth of Lamech, and
he had other sons and daughters. 27 The whole lifetime of Methuselah was nine hundred and
sixty-nine years; then he died.
Books of Moses

28 When Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two years old, he begot a son 29 and named
him Noah, saying, “Out of the very ground that the LORD has put under a curse, this one shall
bring us relief from our work and the toil of our hands.” 30 Lamech lived five hundred and
ninety-five years after the birth of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters. 31 The whole
lifetime of Lamech was seven hundred and seventy-seven years; then he died.
32 When Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and
Japheth.
Gen. 6
Origin of the Nephilim. 1 When men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born
to them, 2 the sons of heaven saw how beautiful the daughters of man were, and so they took for
their wives as many of them as they chose. 3 Then the LORD said: “My spirit shall not remain in
man forever, since he is but flesh. His days shall comprise one hundred and twenty years.”
4 At that time the Nephilim appeared on earth (as well as later), after the sons of heaven had
intercourse with the daughters of man, who bore them sons. They were the heroes of old, the
men of renown.
Warning of the Flood. 5 When the LORD saw how great was man’s wickedness on earth,
and how no desire that his heart conceived was ever anything but evil, 6 he regretted that he had
made man on the earth, and his heart was grieved.
7 So the LORD said: “I will wipe out from the earth the men whom I have created, and not
only the men, but also the beasts and the creeping things and the birds of the air, for I am sorry
that I made them.” 8 But Noah found favor with the LORD.
9 These are the descendants of Noah. Noah, a good man and blameless in that age, 10 for he
walked with God, begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
11 In the eyes of God the earth was corrupt and full of lawlessness. 12 When God saw how
corrupt the earth had become, since all mortals led depraved lives on earth, 13 he said to Noah:
“I have decided to put an end to all mortals on earth; the earth is full of lawlessness because of
them. So I will destroy them and all life on earth.
Preparation for the Flood. 14 “Make yourself an ark of gopherwood, put various
compartments in it, and cover it inside and out with pitch. 15 This is how you shall build it: the
length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
16 Make an opening for daylight in the ark, and finish the ark a cubit above it. Put an entrance in
the side of the ark, which you shall make with bottom, second and third decks. 17 I, on my part,
am about to bring the flood (waters) on the earth, to destroy everywhere all creatures in which
there is the breath of life; everything on earth shall perish. 18 But with you I will establish my
covenant; you and your sons, your wife and your sons’ wives, shall go into the ark. 19 Of all
other living creatures you shall bring two into the ark, one male and one female, that you may
keep them alive with you. 20 Of all kinds of birds, of all kinds of beasts, and of all kinds of
creeping things, two of each shall come into the ark with you, to stay alive. 21 Moreover, you are
to provide yourself with all the food that is to be eaten, and store it away, that it may serve as
provisions for you and for them.” 22 This Noah did; he carried out all the commands that God
gave him.
Gen. 7
1 Then the LORD said to Noah: “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for you alone
in this age have I found to be truly just. 2 Of every clean animal, take with you seven pairs, a
male and its mate; and of the unclean animals, one pair, a male and its mate; 3 likewise, of every
clean bird of the air, seven pairs, a male and a female, and of all the unclean birds, one pair, a
male and a female. Thus you will keep their issue alive over all the earth. 4 Seven days from now
I will bring rain down on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and so I will wipe out from the
Books of Moses

7

surface of the earth every moving creature that I have made.” 5 Noah did just as the LORD had
commanded him.
The Great Flood. 6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood waters came upon the
earth. 7 Together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, Noah went into the ark because of
the waters of the flood. 8 Of the clean animals and the unclean, of the birds, and of everything
that creeps on the ground, 9 (two by two) male and female entered the ark with Noah, just as the
LORD had commanded him. 10 As soon as the seven days were over, the waters of the flood
came upon the earth.
11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of
the month: it was on that day that All the fountains of the great abyss burst forth, and the
floodgates of the sky were opened. 12 For forty days and forty nights heavy rain poured down on
the earth.
13 On the precise day named, Noah and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah’s wife,
and the three wives of Noah’s sons had entered the ark, 14 together with every kind of wild
beast, every kind of domestic animal, every kind of creeping thing of the earth, and every kind of
bird. 15 Pairs of all creatures in which there was the breath of life entered the ark with Noah. 16
Those that entered were male and female, and of all species they came, as God had commanded
Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
17 The flood continued upon the earth for forty days. As the waters increased, they lifted the
ark, so that it rose above the earth. 18 The swelling waters increased greatly, but the ark floated
on the surface of the waters. 19 Higher and higher above the earth rose the waters, until all the
highest mountains everywhere were submerged, 20 the crest rising fifteen cubits higher than the
submerged mountains. 21 All creatures that stirred on earth perished: birds, cattle, wild animals,
and all that swarmed on the earth, as well as all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land with the
faintest breath of life in its nostrils died out. 23 The LORD wiped out every living thing on earth:
man and cattle, the creeping things and the birds of the air; all were wiped out from the earth.
Only Noah and those with him in the ark were left.
Gen. 8
7:24 The waters maintained their crest over the earth for one hundred and fifty days,1 and
then God remembered Noah and all the animals, wild and tame, that were with him in the ark. So
God made a wind sweep over the earth, and the waters began to subside. 2 The fountains of the
abyss and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the downpour from the sky was held back. 3
Gradually the waters receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred and fifty days, the waters
had so diminished 4 that, in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark
came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 5 The waters continued to diminish until the tenth
month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains appeared.
6 At the end of forty days Noah opened the hatch he had made in the ark, 7 and he sent out a
raven, to see if the waters had lessened on the earth. It flew back and forth until the waters dried
off from the earth. 8 Then he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had lessened on the earth. 9 But
the dove could find no place to alight and perch, and it returned to him in the ark, for there was
water all over the earth. Putting out his hand, he caught the dove and drew it back to him inside
the ark. 10 He waited seven days more and again sent the dove out from the ark. 11 In the
evening the dove came back to him, and there in its bill was a plucked-off olive leaf! So Noah
knew that the waters had lessened on the earth. 12 He waited still another seven days and then
released the dove once more; and this time it did not come back.
13 In the six hundred and first year of Noah’s life, in the first month, on the first day of the
month, the water began to dry up on the earth. Noah then removed the covering of the ark and
saw that the surface of the ground was drying up. 14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh
day of the month, the earth was dry.
Books of Moses

15 Then God said to Noah: 16 “Go out of the ark, together with your wife and your sons and
your sons’ wives. 17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you—all bodily creatures,
be they birds or animals or creeping things of the earth-and let them abound on the earth,
breeding and multiplying on it.” 18 So Noah came out, together with his wife and his sons and
his sons’ wives; 19 and all the animals, wild and tame, all the birds, and all the creeping
creatures of the earth left the ark, one kind after another.
20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and choosing from every clean animal and every
clean bird, he offered holocausts on the altar. 21 When the LORD smelled the sweet odor, he
said to himself: “Never again will I doom the earth because of man, since the desires of man’s
heart are evil from the start; nor will I ever again strike down all living beings, as I have done. 22
As long as the earth lasts, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, Summer and winter, and day and
night shall not cease.”
Gen. 9
Covenant with Noah. 1 God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them: “Be fertile and
multiply and fill the earth. 2 Dread fear of you shall come upon all the animals of the earth and
all the birds of the air, upon all the creatures that move about on the ground and all the fishes of
the sea; into your power they are delivered. 3 Every creature that is alive shall be yours to eat; I
give them all to you as I did the green plants. 4 Only flesh with its lifeblood still in it you shall
not eat. 5 For your own lifeblood, too, I will demand an accounting: from every animal I will
demand it, and from man in regard to his fellow man I will demand an accounting for human life.
6 If anyone sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; For in the image of God
has man been made. 7 Be fertile, then, and multiply; abound on earth and subdue it.”
8 God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 “See, I am now establishing my covenant
with you and your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that was with you: all
the birds, and the various tame and wild animals that were with you and came out of the ark. 11 I
will establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all bodily creatures be destroyed by
the waters of a flood; there shall not be another flood to devastate the earth.” 12 God added:
“This is the sign that I am giving for all ages to come, of the covenant between me and you and
every living creature with you: 13 I set my bow in the clouds to serve as a sign of the covenant
between me and the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow appears in the
clouds, 15 I will recall the covenant I have made between me and you and all living beings, so
that the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all mortal beings. 16 As the bow
appears in the clouds, I will see it and recall the everlasting covenant that I have established
between God and all living beings—all mortal creatures that are on earth.” 17 God told Noah:
“This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all mortal creatures that are
on earth.”
Noah and His Sons. 18 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and
Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from them
the whole earth was peopled.
20 Now Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard. 21 When he drank some of
the wine, he became drunk and lay naked inside his tent. 22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his
father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside about it. 23 Shem and Japheth, however,
took a robe, and holding it on their backs, they walked backward and covered their father’s
nakedness; since their faces were turned the other way, they did not see their father’s nakedness.
24 When Noah woke up from his drunkenness and learned what his youngest son had done to
him, 25 he said: “Cursed be Caanan! The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.” 26 He also
said: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! Let Canaan be his slave. 27 May God expand
Japheth, so that he dwells among the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.”
28 Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 29 The whole lifetime of Noah

9

was nine hundred and fifty years; then he died.
Gen. 10
Table of the Nations. 1 These are the descendants of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth, to whom sons were born after the flood.
2 The descendants of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
3 The descendants of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
4 The descendants of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim, and the Rodanim.
5 These are the descendants of Japheth, and from them sprang the maritime nations, in their
respective lands—each with its own language—by their clans within their nations.
6 The descendants of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
7 The descendants of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
The descendants of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
8 Cush became the father of Nimrod, who was the first potentate on earth. 9 He was a
mighty hunter by the grace of the LORD; hence the saying, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter by
the grace of the LORD.” 10 The chief cities of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, and Accad, all
of them in the land of Shinar. 11 From that land he went forth to Asshur, where he built Nineveh,
Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 12 as well as Resen, between Nineveh and Calah, the latter being the
principal city.
13 Mizraim became the father of the Ludim, the Anamim, the Lehabim, the Naphtuhim, 14
the Pathrusim, the Casluhim, and the Caphtorim from whom the Philistines sprang.
15 Canaan became the father of Sidon, his first-born, and of Heth; 16 also of the Jebusites,
the Amorites, the Girgashites, 17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 18 the Arvadites, the
Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward, the clans of the Canaanites spread out, 19 so that the
Canaanite borders extended from Sidon all the way to Gerar, near Gaza, and all the way to
Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, near Lasha.
20 These are the descendants of Ham, according to their clans and languages, by their lands
and nations.
21 To Shem also, Japheth’s oldest brother and the ancestor of all the children of Eber, sons
were born. 22 The descendants of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 23 The
descendants of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah, and Shelah became the father of Eber. 25 To
Eber two sons were born: the name of the first was Peleg, for in his time the world was divided;
and the name of his brother was Joktan.
26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27 Hadoram, Uzal,
Diklah, 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were descendants of
Joktan. 30 Their settlements extended all the way to Sephar, the eastern hill country.
31 These are the descendants of Shem, according to their clans and languages by their lands
and nations.
32 These are the groupings of Noah’s sons, according to their origins and by their nations.
From these the other nations of the earth branched out after the flood.
Gen. 11
The Tower of Babel. 1 The whole world spoke the same language, using the same words. 2
While men were migrating in the east, they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled
there. 3 They said to one another, “Come, let us mold bricks and harden them with fire.” They
used bricks for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a
city and a tower with its top in the sky, and so make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be
scattered all over the earth.”
5 The LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men had built. 6 Then the
Books of Moses

10

LORD said: “If now, while they are one people, all speaking the same language, they have
started to do this, nothing will later stop them from doing whatever they presume to do. 7 Let us
then go down and there confuse their language, so that one will not understand what another
says.” 8 Thus the LORD scattered them from there all over the earth, and they stopped building
the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the speech of all
the world. It was from that place that he scattered them all over the earth.
The Line from Shem to Abraham. 10 This is the record of the descendants of Shem. When
Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the flood.
11 Shem lived five hundred years after the birth of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and
daughters.
12 When Arpachshad was thirty-five years old, he became the father of Shelah. 13
Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after the birth of Shelah, and he had other sons
and daughters.
14 When Shelah was thirty years old, he became the father of Eber. 15 Shelah lived four
hundred and three years after the birth of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters.
16 When Eber was thirty-four years old, he became the father of Peleg. 17 Eber lived four
hundred and thirty years after the birth of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters.
18 When Peleg was thirty years old, he became the father of Reu. 19 Peleg lived two
hundred and nine years after the birth of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters.
20 When Reu was thirty-two years old, he became the father of Serug. 21 Reu lived two
hundred and seven years after the birth of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters.
22 When Serug was thirty years old, he became the father of Nahor. 23 Serug lived two
hundred years after the birth of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters.
24 When Nahor was twenty-nine years old, he became the father of Terah. 25 Nahor lived
one hundred and nineteen years after the birth of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters.
26 When Terah was seventy years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
II. THE PATRIARCH ABRAHAM
Terah. 27 This is the record of the descendants of Terah. Terah became the father of
Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran became the father of Lot. 28 Haran died before his father
Terah, in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29 Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of
Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, daughter of Haran, the
father of Milcah and Iscah. 30 Sarai was barren; she had no child.
31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai,
the wife of his son Abram, and brought them out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to go to the land of
Canaan. But when they reached Haran, they settled there. 32 The lifetime of Terah was two
hundred and five years; then Terah died in Haran.
Gen. 12
Abram’s Call and Migration. 1 The LORD said to Abram: “Go forth from the land of your
kinsfolk and from your father’s house to a land that I will show you. 2 “I will make of you a
great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I
will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All the communities of the earth
shall find blessing in you.” 4 Abram went as the LORD directed him, and Lot went with him.
Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. 5 Abram took his wife Sarai, his brother’s
son Lot, all the possessions that they had accumulated, and the persons they had acquired in
Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 6 Abram
passed through the land as far as the sacred place at Shechem, by the terebinth of Moreh. (The
Canaanites were then in the land.)
Books of Moses

11

7 The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So
Abram built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved on to
the hill country east of Bethel, pitching his tent with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. He
built an altar there to the LORD and invoked the LORD by name. 9 Then Abram journeyed on
by stages to the Negeb.
Abram and Sarai in Egypt. 10 There was famine in the land; so Abram went down to
Egypt to sojourn there, since the famine in the land was severe. 11 When he was about to enter
Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai: “I know well how beautiful a woman you are. 12 When the
Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘She is his wife’; then they will kill me, but let you live. 13
Please say, therefore, that you are my sister, so that it may go well with me on your account and
my life may be spared for your sake.” 14 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw how
beautiful the woman was; and when Pharaoh’s courtiers saw her, 15 they praised her to Pharaoh.
So she was taken into Pharaoh’s palace. 16 On her account it went very well with Abram, and he
received flocks and herds, male and female slaves, male and female asses, and camels.
17 But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of
Abram’s wife Sarai. 18 Then Pharaoh summoned Abram and said to him: “How could you do
this to me! Why didn‘t you tell me she was your wife? 19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so
that I took her for my wife? Here, then, is your wife. Take her and be gone!”
20 Then Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him on his way, with his
wife and all that belonged to him.
Gen. 13
Abram and Lot Part. 1 From Egypt Abram went up to the Negeb with his wife and all that
belonged to him, and Lot accompanied him. 2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and
gold. 3 From the Negeb he traveled by stages toward Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai
where his tent had formerly stood, 4 the site where he had first built the altar; and there he
invoked the LORD by name.
5 Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, 6 so that the land could
not support them if they stayed together; their possessions were so great that they could not dwell
together. 7 There were quarrels between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and those of Lot’s.
(At this time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were occupying the land.)
8 So Abram said to Lot: “Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your
herdsmen and mine, for we are kinsmen. 9 Is not the whole land at your disposal? Please
separate from me. If you prefer the left, I will go to the right; if you prefer the right, I will go to
the left.” 10 Lot looked about and saw how well watered the whole Jordan Plain was as far as
Zoar, like the LORD’S own garden, or like Egypt. (This was before the LORD had destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah.) 11 Lot, therefore, chose for himself the whole Jordan Plain and set out
eastward. Thus they separated from each other; 12 Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, while
Lot settled among the cities of the Plain, pitching his tents near Sodom. 13 Now the inhabitants
of Sodom were very wicked in the sins they committed against the LORD.
14 After Lot had left, the LORD said to Abram: “Look about you, and from where you are,
gaze to the north and south, east and west; 15 all the land that you see I will give to you and your
descendants forever. 16 I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth; if anyone could
count the dust of the earth, your descendants too might be counted. 17 Set forth and walk about
in the land, through its length and breadth, for to you I will give it.” 18 Abram moved his tents
and went on to settle near the terebinth of Mamre, which is at Hebron. There he built an altar to
the LORD.

The Four Kings. 1 In the days of... , Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar,
Books of Moses

12

Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim 2 made war on Bera king of Sodom,
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of
Bela (that is, Zoar). 3 All the latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt
Sea). 4 For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they
rebelled. 5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him came and defeated
the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 6 and the
Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as Elparan, close by the wilderness. 7 They then turned
back and came to Enmishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they subdued the whole country both of the
Amalekites and of the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 8 Thereupon the king of Sodom,
the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,
Zoar) marched out, and in the Valley of Siddim they went into battle against them: 9 against
Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
Ellasar - four kings against five. 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits; and as
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into these, while the rest fled to the mountains.
11 The victors seized all the possessions and food supplies of Sodom and Gomorrah and then
went their way, 12 taking with them Abram’s nephew Lot, who had been living in Sodom, as
well as his possessions.
13 A fugitive came and brought the news to Abram the Hebrew, who was camping at the
terebinth of Mamre the Amorite, a kinsman of Eshcol and Aner; these were in league with
Abram. 14 When Abram heard that his nephew had been captured, he mustered three hundred
and eighteen of his retainers, born in his house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 15 He and his
party deployed against them at night, defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is
north of Damascus. 16 He recovered all the possessions, besides bringing back his kinsman Lot
and his possessions, along with the women and the other captives.
17 When Abram returned from his victory over Chedorlaomer and the kings who were allied
with him, the king of Sodom went out to greet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s
Valley).
18 Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine, and being a priest of God Most
High, he blessed Abram with these words: 19 “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, the creator
of heaven and earth; 20 And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your foes into your
hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people; the goods you may keep.” 22
But Abram replied to the king of Sodom: “I have sworn to the LORD, God Most High, the
creator of heaven and earth, 23 that I would not take so much as a thread or a sandal strap from
anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 24 Nothing for me except what
my servants have used up and the share that is due to the men who joined me—Aner, Eshcol and
Mamre; let them take their share.”
Gen. 15
The Covenant with Abram. 1 Some time after these events, this word of the LORD came
to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram! I am your shield; I will make your reward very great.” 2
But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what good will your gifts be, if I keep on being childless and
have as my heir the steward of my house, Eliezer?” 3 Abram continued, “See, you have given me
no offspring, and so one of my servants will be my heir.” 4 Then the word of the LORD came to
him: “No, that one shall not be your heir; your own issue shall be your heir.” 5 He took him
outside and said: “Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can. Just so,” he added, “shall
your descendants be.” 6 Abram put his faith in the LORD, who credited it to him as an act of
righteousness.
7 He then said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give
you this land as a possession.” 8 “O Lord GOD,” he asked, “How am I to know that I shall
Books of Moses

13

possess it?” 9 He answered him, “Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat, a
three-year-old ram, a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.” 10 He brought him all these, split them in
two, and placed each half opposite the other; but the birds he did not cut up. 11 Birds of prey
swooped down on the carcasses, but Abram stayed with them. 12 As the sun was about to set, a
trance fell upon Abram, and a deep, terrifying darkness enveloped him.
13 Then the LORD said to Abram: “Know for certain that your descendants shall be aliens
in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. 14
But I will bring judgment on the nation they must serve, and in the end they will depart with
great wealth. 15 You, however, shall join your forefathers in peace; you shall be buried at a
contented old age. 16 In the fourth time-span the others shall come back here; the wickedness of
the Amorites will not have reached its full measure until then.”
17 When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking brazier and a flaming
torch, which passed between those pieces. 18 It was on that occasion that the LORD made a
covenant with Abram, saying: “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to
the Great River (the Euphrates), 19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 20
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and
the Jebusites.”
Gen. 16
Birth of Ishmael. 1 Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children. She had, however, an
Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. 2 Sarai said to Abram: “The LORD has kept me from
bearing children. Have intercourse, then, with my maid; perhaps I shall have sons through her.”
Abram heeded Sarai’s request. 3 Thus, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, his
wife Sarai took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his
concubine. 4 He had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. When she became aware of
her pregnancy, she looked on her mistress with disdain. 5 So Sarai said to Abram: “You are
responsible for this outrage against me. I myself gave my maid to your embrace; but ever since
she became aware of her pregnancy, she has been looking on me with disdain. May the LORD
decide between you and me!” 6 Abram told Sarai: “Your maid is in your power. Do to her
whatever you please.” Sarai then abused her so much that Hagar ran away from her.
7 The LORD’S messenger found her by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the road to
Shur, 8 and he asked, “Hagar, maid of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you
going?” She answered, “I am running away from my mistress, Sarai.” 9 But the LORD’S
messenger told her: “Go back to your mistress and submit to her abusive treatment. 10 I will
make your descendants so numerous,” added the LORD’S messenger, “that they will be too
many to count. 11 Besides,” the LORD’S messenger said to her: “You are now pregnant and
shall bear a son; you shall name him Ishmael, For the LORD has heard you, God has answered
you. 12 He shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against everyone, and everyone’s hand against
him; In opposition to all his kin shall he encamp.”
13 To the LORD who spoke to her she gave a name, saying, “You are the God of Vision”;
she meant, “Have I really seen God and remained alive after my vision?” 14 That is why the well
is called Beer-lahai-roi. It is between Kadesh and Bered.
15 Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named the son whom Hagar bore him Ishmael. 16
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
Gen. 17
Covenant of Circumcision. 1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared
to him and said: “I am God the Almighty. Walk in my presence and be blameless. 2 Between you
and me I will establish my covenant, and I will multiply you exceedingly.”
3 When Abram prostrated himself, God continued to speak to him: 4 “My covenant with
Books of Moses

14

you is this: you are to become the father of a host of nations. 5 No longer shall you be called
Abram; your name shall be Abraham, for I am making you the father of a host of nations. 6 I will
render you exceedingly fertile; I will make nations of you; kings shall stem from you. 7 I will
maintain my covenant with you and your descendants after you throughout the ages as an
everlasting pact, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. 8 I will give to you
and to your descendants after you the land in which you are now staying, the whole land of
Canaan, as a permanent possession; and I will be their God.”
9 God also said to Abraham: “On your part, you and your descendants after you must keep
my covenant throughout the ages. 10 This is my covenant with you and your descendants after
you that you must keep: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 Circumcise the flesh of
your foreskin, and that shall be the mark of the covenant between you and me. 12 Throughout
the ages, every male among you, when he is eight days old, shall be circumcised, including
houseborn slaves and those acquired with money from any foreigner who is not of your blood.
13 Yes, both the houseborn slaves and those acquired with money must be circumcised. Thus my
covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting pact. 14 If a male is uncircumcised, that is, if the
flesh of his foreskin has not been cut away, such a one shall be cut off from his people; he has
broken my covenant.”
15 God further said to Abraham: “As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai; her name
shall be Sarah. 16 I will bless her, and I will give you a son by her. Him also will I bless; he shall
give rise to nations, and rulers of peoples shall issue from him.” 17 Abraham prostrated himself
and laughed as he said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Or
can Sarah give birth at ninety?” 18 Then Abraham said to God, “Let but Ishmael live on by your
favor!” 19 God replied: “Nevertheless, your wife Sarah is to bear you a son, and you shall call
him Isaac. I will maintain my covenant with him as an everlasting pact, to be his God and the
God of his descendants after him. 20 As for Ishmael, I am heeding you: I hereby bless him. I will
make him fertile and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve
chieftains, and I will make of him a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will maintain with Isaac,
whom Sarah shall bear to you by this time next year.” 22 When he had finished speaking with
him, God departed from Abraham.
23 Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all his slaves, whether born in his house or
acquired with his money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and he
circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that same day, as God had told him to do. 24 Abraham
was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised, 25 and his son Ishmael
was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised. 26 Thus, on that same day
Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised; 27 and all the male members of his household,
including the slaves born in his house or acquired with his money from foreigners, were
circumcised with him.
Gen. 18
Abraham’s Visitors. 1 The LORD appeared to Abraham by the terebinth of Mamre, as he
sat in the entrance of his tent, while the day was growing hot. 2 Looking up, he saw three men
standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them; and
bowing to the ground, 3 he said: “Sir, if I may ask you this favor, please do not go on past your
servant. 4 Let some water be brought, that you may bathe your feet, and then rest yourselves
under the tree. 5 Now that you have come this close to your servant, let me bring you a little
food, that you may refresh yourselves; and afterward you may go on your way.” “Very well,”
they replied, “do as you have said.”
6 Abraham hastened into the tent and told Sarah, “Quick, three seahs of fine flour! Knead it
and make rolls.” 7 He ran to the herd, picked out a tender, choice steer, and gave it to a servant,
who quickly prepared it. 8 Then he got some curds and milk, as well as the steer that had been
Books of Moses

15

prepared, and set these before them; and he waited on them under the tree while they ate.
9 “Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There in the tent,” he replied. 10 One of
them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah will then have a son.”
Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, just behind him. 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were
old, advanced in years, and Sarah had stopped having her womanly periods. 12 So Sarah laughed
to herself and said, “Now that I am so withered and my husband is so old, am I still to have
sexual pleasure?” 13 But the LORD said to Abraham: “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I
really bear a child, old as I am?’ 14 Is anything too marvelous for the LORD to do? At the
appointed time, about this time next year, I will return to you, and Sarah will have a son.” 15
Because she was afraid, Sarah dissembled, saying, “I didn‘t laugh.” But he said, “Yes you did.”
Abraham Intercedes for Sodom. 16 The men set out from there and looked down toward
Sodom; Abraham was walking with them, to see them on their way. 17 The LORD reflected:
“Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, 18 now that he is to become a great and
populous nation, and all the nations of the earth are to find blessing in him? 19 Indeed, I have
singled him out that he may direct his sons and his posterity to keep the way of the LORD by
doing what is right and just, so that the LORD may carry into effect for Abraham the promises
he made about him.” 20 Then the LORD said: “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so
great, and their sin so grave, 21 that I must go down and see whether or not their actions fully
correspond to the cry against them that comes to me. I mean to find out.”
22 While the two men walked on farther toward Sodom, the LORD remained standing
before Abraham. 23 Then Abraham drew nearer to him and said: “Will you sweep away the
innocent with the guilty? 24 Suppose there were fifty innocent people in the city; would you
wipe out the place, rather than spare it for the sake of the fifty innocent people within it? 25 Far
be it from you to do such a thing, to make the innocent die with the guilty, so that the innocent
and the guilty would be treated alike! Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?” 26
The LORD replied, “If I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole
place for their sake.” 27 Abraham spoke up again: “See how I am presuming to speak to my
Lord, though I am but dust and ashes! 28 What if there are five less than fifty innocent people?
Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?” “I will not destroy it,” he answered, “if I
find forty-five there.” 29 But Abraham persisted, saying, “What if only forty are found there?”
He replied, “I will forebear doing it for the sake of the forty.” 30 Then he said, “Let not my Lord
grow impatient if I go on. What if only thirty are found there?” He replied, “I will forebear doing
it if I can find but thirty there.” 31 Still he went on, “Since I have thus dared to speak to my
Lord, what if there are no more than twenty?” “I will not destroy it,” he answered, “for the sake
of the twenty.” 32 But he still persisted: “Please, let not my Lord grow angry if I speak up this
last time. What if there are at least ten there?” “For the sake of those ten,” he replied, “I will not
destroy it.”
33 The LORD departed as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham
returned home.
Gen. 19
Destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah. 1 The two angels reached Sodom in the evening, as
Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up to greet them; and bowing
down with his face to the ground, 2 he said, “Please, gentlemen, come aside into your servant’s
house for the night, and bathe your feet; you can get up early to continue your journey.” But they
replied, “No, we shall pass the night in the town square.” 3 He urged them so strongly, however,
that they turned aside to his place and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking
cakes without leaven, and they dined.
4 Before they went to bed, all the townsmen of Sodom, both young and old—all the people
to the last man—closed in on the house. 5 They called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the
Books of Moses

16

men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have intimacies with
them.” 6 Lot went out to meet them at the entrance. When he had shut the door behind him, 7 he
said, “I beg you, my brothers, not to do this wicked thing. 8 I have two daughters who have
never had intercourse with men. Let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you
please. But don‘t do anything to these men, for you know they have come under the shelter of
my roof.” 9 They replied, “Stand back! This fellow,” they sneered, “came here as an immigrant,
and now he dares to give orders! We‘ll treat you worse than them!” With that, they pressed hard
against Lot, moving in closer to break down the door. 10 But his guests put out their hands,
pulled Lot inside with them, and closed the door; 11 at the same time they struck the men at the
entrance of the house, one and all, with such a blinding light that they were utterly unable to
reach the doorway.
12 Then the angels said to Lot: “Who else belongs to you here? Your sons (sons-in-law) and
your daughters and all who belong to you in the city—take them away from it! 13 We are about
to destroy this place, for the outcry reaching the LORD against those in the city is so great that
he has sent us to destroy it.” 14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had
contracted marriage with his daughters. “Get up and leave this place,” he told them; “the LORD
is about to destroy the city.” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
15 As dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot on, saying, “On your way! Take with you
your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of
the city.” 16 When he hesitated, the men, by the LORD’S mercy, seized his hand and the hands
of his wife and his two daughters and led them to safety outside the city. 17 As soon as they had
been brought outside, he was told: “Flee for your life! Don‘t look back or stop anywhere on the
Plain. Get off to the hills at once, or you will be swept away.” 18 “Oh, no, my lord!” replied Lot.
19 “You have already thought enough of your servant to do me the great kindness of intervening
to save my life. But I cannot flee to the hills to keep the disaster from overtaking me, and so I
shall die. 20 Look, this town ahead is near enough to escape to. It’s only a small place. Let me
flee there—it’s a small place, isn‘t it?—that my life may be saved.” 21 “Well, then,” he replied,
“I will also grant you the favor you now ask. I will not overthrow the town you speak of. 22
Hurry, escape there! I cannot do anything until you arrive there.” That is why the town is called
Zoar.
23 The sun was just rising over the earth as Lot arrived in Zoar; 24 at the same time the
LORD rained down sulphurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah (from the LORD out of heaven).
25 He overthrew those cities and the whole Plain, together with the inhabitants of the cities and
the produce of the soil. 26 But Lot’s wife looked back, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.
27 Early the next morning Abraham went to the place where he had stood in the LORD’S
presence. 28 As he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole region of the Plain,
he saw dense smoke over the land rising like fumes from a furnace.
29 Thus it came to pass: when God destroyed the Cities of the Plain, he was mindful of
Abraham by sending Lot away from the upheaval by which God overthrew the cities where Lot
had been living.
Moabites and Ammonites. 30 Since Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, he and his two
daughters went up from Zoar and settled in the hill country, where he lived with his two
daughters in a cave. 31 The older one said to the younger: “Our father is getting old, and there is
not a man on earth to unite with us as was the custom everywhere. 32 Come, let us ply our father
with wine and then lie with him, that we may have offspring by our father.” 33 So that night they
plied their father with wine, and the older one went in and lay with her father; but he was not
aware of her lying down or her getting up. 34 Next day the older one said to the younger: “Last
night it was I who lay with my father. Let us ply him with wine again tonight, and then you go in
and lie with him, that we may both have offspring by our father.” 35 So that night, too, they plied
their father with wine, and then the younger one went in and lay with him; but again he was not

aware of her lying down or her getting up.
36 Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older one gave
birth to a son whom she named Moab, saying, “From my father.” He is the ancestor of the
Moabites of today. 38 The younger one, too, gave birth to a son, and she named him Ammon,
saying, “The son of my kin.” He is the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.
Gen. 20
Abraham at Gerar. 1 Abraham journeyed on to the region of the Negeb, where he settled
between Kadesh and Shur. While he stayed in Gerar, 2 he said of his wife Sarah, “She is my
sister.” So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah. 3 But God came to Abimelech in a
dream one night and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman you have taken,
for she has a husband.” 4 Abimelech, who had not approached her, said: “O Lord, would you
slay a man even though he is innocent? 5 He himself told me, ‘She is my sister,’ and she herself
also stated, ‘He is my brother.’ I did it in good faith and with clean hands.” 6 God answered him
in the dream: “Yes, I know you did it in good faith. In fact, it was I who kept you from sinning
against me; that is why I did not let you touch her. 7 Therefore, return the man’s wife—as a
spokesman he will intercede for you—that your life may be saved. If you do not return her, you
can be sure that you and all who are yours will certainly die.”
8 Early the next morning Abimelech called all his court officials and informed them of
everything that had happened, and the men were horrified. 9 Then Abimelech summoned
Abraham and said to him: “How could you do this to us! What wrong did I do to you that you
should have brought such monstrous guilt on me and my kingdom? You have treated me in an
intolerable way. 10 What were you afraid of,” he asked him, “that you should have done such a
thing?” 11 “I was afraid,” answered Abraham, “because I thought there would surely be no fear
of God in this place, and so they would kill me on account of my wife. 12 Besides, she is in truth
my sister, but only my father’s daughter, not my mother’s; and so she became my wife. 13 When
God sent me wandering from my father’s house, I asked her: ‘Would you do me this favor? In
whatever place we come to, say that I am your brother.’”
14 Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves and gave them to
Abraham; and after he restored his wife Sarah to him, 15 he said, “Here, my land lies at your
disposal; settle wherever you please.” 16 To Sarah he said: “See, I have given your brother a
thousand shekels of silver. Let that serve you as a vindication before all who are with you; your
honor has been preserved with everyone.” 17 Abraham then interceded with God, and God
restored health to Abimelech, that is, to his wife and his maidservants, so that they could bear
children; 18 for God had tightly closed every womb in Abimelech’s household on account of
Abraham’s wife Sarah.
Gen. 21
Birth of Isaac. 1 The LORD took note of Sarah as he had said he would; he did for her as
he had promised. 2 Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time
that God had stated. 3 Abraham gave the name Isaac to this son of his whom Sarah bore him.
4 When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded. 5
Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 6 Sarah then said, “God
has given me cause to laugh, and all who hear of it will laugh with me. 7 Who would have told
Abraham,” she added, “that Sarah would nurse children! Yet I have borne him a son in his old
age.” 8 Isaac grew, and on the day of the child’s weaning, Abraham held a great feast.
9 Sarah noticed the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham playing with her
son Isaac; 10 so she demanded of Abraham: “Drive out that slave and her son! No son of that
slave is going to share the inheritance with my son Isaac!” 11 Abraham was greatly distressed,
especially on account of his son Ishmael. 12 But God said to Abraham: “Do not be distressed

about the boy or about your slave woman. Heed the demands of Sarah, no matter what she is
asking of you; for it is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name. 13 As for the son of
the slave woman, I will make a great nation of him also, since he too is your offspring.”
14 Early the next morning Abraham got some bread and a skin of water and gave them to
Hagar. Then, placing the child on her back, he sent her away. As she roamed aimlessly in the
wilderness of Beer-sheba, 15 the water in the skin was used up. So she put the child down under
a shrub, 16 and then went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away; for she said to
herself, “Let me not watch to see the child die.” As she sat opposite him, he began to cry. 17 God
heard the boy’s cry, and God’s messenger called to Hagar from heaven: “What is the matter,
Hagar? Don‘t be afraid; God has heard the boy’s cry in this plight of his. 18 Arise, lift up the boy
and hold him by the hand; for I will make of him a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes,
and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and then let the boy drink.
20 God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert
bowman, 21 with his home in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him from the
land of Egypt.
The Pact at Beer-sheba. 22 About that time Abimelech, accompanied by Phicol, the
commander of his army, said to Abraham: “God is with you in everything you do. 23 Therefore,
swear to me by God at this place that you will not deal falsely with me or with my progeny and
posterity, but will act as loyally toward me and the land in which you stay as I have acted toward
you.” 24 To this Abraham replied, “I so swear.”
25 Abraham, however, reproached Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s men had seized
by force. 26 “I have no idea who did that,” Abimelech replied. “In fact, you never told me about
it, nor did I ever hear of it until now.”
27 Then Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech and the two made a
pact. 28 Abraham also set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock, 29 and Abimelech asked him,
“What is the purpose of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” 30 Abraham answered,
“The seven ewe lambs you shall accept from me that thus I may have your acknowledgment that
the well was dug by me.” 31 This is why the place is called Beer-sheba; the two took an oath
there. 32 When they had thus made the pact in Beer-sheba, Abimelech, along with Phicol, the
commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
33 Abraham planted a tamarisk at Beer-sheba, and there he invoked by name the LORD,
God the Eternal. 34 Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for many years.
Gen. 22
The Testing of Abraham. 1 Some time after these events, God put Abraham to the test. He
called to him, “Abraham!” “Ready!” he replied. 2 Then God said: “Take your son Isaac, your
only one, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There you shall offer him up as a
holocaust on a height that I will point out to you.” 3 Early the next morning Abraham saddled his
donkey, took with him his son Isaac, and two of his servants as well, and with the wood that he
had cut for the holocaust, set out for the place of which God had told him.
4 On the third day Abraham got sight of the place from afar. 5 Then he said to his servants:
“Both of you stay here with the donkey, while the boy and I go on over yonder. We will worship
and then come back to you.” 6 Thereupon Abraham took the wood for the holocaust and laid it
on his son Isaac’s shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. 7 As the two walked
on together, Isaac spoke to his father Abraham. “Father!” he said. “Yes, son,” he replied. Isaac
continued, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the holocaust?” 8 “Son,”
Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the sheep for the holocaust.” Then the two
continued going forward.
9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and
arranged the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac, and put him on top of the wood on the
Books of Moses

19

altar. 10 Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son. 11 But the LORD’S
messenger called to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered. 12 “Do
not lay your hand on the boy,” said the messenger. “Do not do the least thing to him. I know now
how devoted you are to God, since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son.” 13 As
Abraham looked about, he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So he went and took the
ram and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son. 14 Abraham named the site Yahwehyireh; hence people now say, “On the mountain the LORD will see.”
15 Again the LORD’S messenger called to Abraham from heaven 16 and said: “I swear by
myself, declares the LORD, that because you acted as you did in not withholding from me your
beloved son, 17 I will bless you abundantly and make your descendants as countless as the stars
of the sky and the sands of the seashore; your descendants shall take possession of the gates of
their enemies, 18 and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing—all this
because you obeyed my command.’’
19 Abraham then returned to his servants, and they set out together for Beer-sheba, where
Abraham made his home.
Nahor’s Descendants. 20 Some time afterward, the news came to Abraham: “Milcah too
has borne sons, to your brother Nahor: 21 Uz, his first-born, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father
of Aram), 22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 23 Bethuel became the father of
Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Abraham’s brother Nahor. 24 His concubine, whose name
was Reumah, also bore children: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
Gen. 23
Purchase of a Burial Place. 1 The span of Sarah’s life was one hundred and twenty-seven
years. 2 She died in Kiriatharba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham performed
the customary mourning rites for her. 3 Then he left the side of his dead one and addressed the
Hittites: 4 “Although I am a resident alien among you, sell me from your holdings a piece of
property for a burial ground, that I may bury my dead wife.” 5 The Hittites answered Abraham:
“Please, sir, 6 listen to us! You are an elect of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of
our burial sites. None of us would deny you his burial ground for the burial of your dead.” 7
Abraham, however, began to bow low before the local citizens, the Hittites, 8 while he appealed
to them: “If you will allow me room for burial of my dead, listen to me! Intercede for me with
Ephron, son of Zohar, asking him 9 to sell me the cave of Machpelah that he owns; it is at the
edge of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence, at its full price, for a burial place.”
10 Now Ephron was present with the Hittites. So Ephron the Hittite replied to Abraham in
the hearing of the Hittites who sat on his town council: 11 “Please, sir, listen to me! I give you
both the field and the cave in it; in the presence of my kinsmen I make this gift. Bury your
dead!” 12 But Abraham, after bowing low before the local citizens, addressed Ephron in the
hearing of these men: 13 “Ah, if only you would please listen to me! I will pay you the price of
the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.” 14 Ephron replied to Abraham,
“Please, 15 sir, listen to me! A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that
between you and me, as long as you can bury your dead?” 16 Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms;
he weighed out to him the silver that Ephron had stipulated in the hearing of the Hittites, four
hundred shekels of silver at the current market value.
17 Thus Ephron’s field in Machpelah, facing Mamre, together with its cave and all the trees
anywhere within its limits, was conveyed 18 to Abraham by purchase in the presence of all the
Hittites who sat on Ephron’s town council. 19 After this transaction, Abraham buried his wife
Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah, facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of
Canaan. 20 Thus the field with its cave was transferred from the Hittites to Abraham as a burial
place.

Gen. 24
Isaac and Rebekah. 1 Abraham had now reached a ripe old age, and the LORD had
blessed him in every way. 2 Abraham said to the senior servant of his household, who had
charge of all his possessions: “Put your hand under my thigh, 3 and I will make you swear by the
LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not procure a wife for my son from
the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live, 4 but that you will go to my own land and to
my kindred to get a wife for my son Isaac.” 5 The servant asked him: “What if the woman is
unwilling to follow me to this land? Should I then take your son back to the land from which you
migrated?” 6 “Never take my son back there for any reason,” Abraham told him. 7 “The LORD,
the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and the land of my kin, and who
confirmed by oath the promise he then made to me, ‘I will give this land to your descendants’—
he will send his messenger before you, and you will obtain a wife for my son there. 8 If the
woman is unwilling to follow you, you will be released from this oath. But never take my son
back there!” 9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to
him in this undertaking.
10 The servant then took ten of his master’s camels, and bearing all kinds of gifts from his
master, he made his way to the city of Nahor in Aram Naharaim. 11 Near evening, at the time
when women go out to draw water, he made the camels kneel by the well outside the city. 12
Then he prayed: “LORD, God of my master Abraham, let it turn out favorably for me today and
thus deal graciously with my master Abraham. 13 While I stand here at the spring and the
daughters of the townsmen are coming out to draw water, 14 if I say to a girl, ‘Please lower your
jug, that I may drink,’ and she answers, ‘Take a drink, and let me give water to your camels,
too,’ let her be the one whom you have decided upon for your servant Isaac. In this way I shall
know that you have dealt graciously with my master.”
15 He had scarcely finished these words when Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of
Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor) came out with a jug on her shoulder. 16 The girl
was very beautiful, a virgin, untouched by man. She went down to the spring and filled her jug.
As she came up, 17 the servant ran toward her and said, “Please give me a sip of water from your
jug.” 18 “Take a drink, sir,” she replied, and quickly lowering the jug onto her hand, she gave
him a drink. 19 When she had let him drink his fill, she said, “I will draw water for your camels,
too, until they have drunk their fill.” 20 With that, she quickly emptied her jug into the drinking
trough and ran back to the well to draw more water, until she had drawn enough for all the
camels. 21 The man watched her the whole time, silently waiting to learn whether or not the
LORD had made his errand successful. 22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took
out a gold ring weighing half a shekel, which he fastened on her nose, and two gold bracelets
weighing ten shekels, which he put on her wrists. 23 Then he asked her: “Whose daughter are
you? Tell me, please. And is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” 24 She
answered: “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor. 25 There is
plenty of straw and fodder at our place,” she added, “and room to spend the night.” 26 The man
then bowed down in worship to the LORD, 27 saying: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my
master Abraham, who has not let his constant kindness toward my master fail. As for myself
also, the LORD has led me straight to the house of my master’s brother.”
28 Then the girl ran off and told her mother’s household about it. 29 Now Rebekah had a
brother named Laban. 30 As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister Rebekah and
heard her words about what the man had said to her, Laban rushed outside to the man at the
spring. When he reached him, he was still standing by the camels at the spring. 31 So he said to
him: “Come, blessed of the LORD! Why are you staying outside when I have made the house
ready for you, as well as a place for the camels?” 32 The man then went inside; and while the
camels were being unloaded and provided with straw and fodder, water was brought to bathe his
feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33 But when the table was set for him, he said,
Books of Moses

21

“I will not eat until I have told my tale.” “Do so,” they replied.
34 “I am Abraham’s servant,” he began. 35 “The LORD has blessed my master so
abundantly that he has become a wealthy man; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and
gold, male and female slaves, and camels and asses. 36 My master’s wife Sarah bore a son to my
master in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. 37 My master put me under
oath, saying: ‘You shall not procure a wife for my son among the daughters of the Canaanites in
whose land I live; 38 instead, you shall go to my father’s house, to my own relatives, to get a
wife for my son.’ 39 When I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?,’ 40 he
replied: ‘The LORD, in whose presence I have always walked, will send his messenger with you
and make your errand successful, and so you will get a wife for my son from my own kindred of
my father’s house. 41 Then you shall be released from my ban. If you visit my kindred and they
refuse you, then, too, you shall be released from my ban.’
42 “When I came to the spring today, I prayed: ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, may it
be your will to make successful the errand I am engaged on! 43 While I stand here at the spring,
if I say to a young woman who comes out to draw water, Please give me a little water from your
jug, 44 and she answers, Not only may you have a drink, but I will give water to your camels,
too—let her be the woman whom the LORD has decided upon for my master’s son.’
45 “I had scarcely finished saying this prayer to myself when Rebekah came out with a jug
on her shoulder. After she went down to the spring and drew water, I said to her, ‘Please let me
have a drink.’ 46 She quickly lowered the jug she was carrying and said, ‘Take a drink, and let
me bring water for your camels, too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also. 47 When I
asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ she answered, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor,
borne to Nahor by Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 48 Then
I bowed down in worship to the LORD, blessing the LORD, the God of my master Abraham,
who had led me on the right road to obtain the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son. 49
If, therefore, you have in mind to show true loyalty to my master, let me know; but if not, let me
know that, too. I can then proceed accordingly.”
50 Laban and his household said in reply: “This thing comes from the LORD; we can say
nothing to you either for or against it. 51 Here is Rebekah, ready for you; take her with you, that
she may become the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has said.” 52 When Abraham’s
servant heard their answer, he bowed to the ground before the LORD. 53 Then he brought out
objects of silver and gold and articles of clothing and presented them to Rebekah; he also gave
costly presents to her brother and mother. 54 After he and the men with him had eaten and drunk,
they spent the night there.
When they were up the next morning, he said, “Give me leave to return to my master.” 55
Her brother and mother replied, “Let the girl stay with us a short while, say ten days; after that
she may go.” 56 But he said to them, “Do not detain me, now that the LORD has made my
errand successful; let me go back to my master.” 57 They answered, “Let us call the girl and see
what she herself has to say about it.” 58 So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you wish to
go with this man?” She answered, “I do.” 59 At this they allowed their sister Rebekah and her
nurse to take leave, along with Abraham’s servant and his men. 60 Invoking a blessing on
Rebekah, they said: “Sister, may you grow into thousands of myriads; And may your
descendants gain possession of the gates of their enemies!” 61 Then Rebekah and her maids
started out; they mounted their camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and
went on his way.
62 Meanwhile Isaac had gone from Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the region of the Negeb.
63 One day toward evening he went out...in the field, and as he looked around, he noticed that
camels were approaching. 64 Rebekah, too, was looking about, and when she saw him, she
alighted from her camel 65 and asked the servant, “Who is the man out there, walking through
the fields toward us?” “That is my master,” replied the servant. Then she covered herself with
Books of Moses

22

her veil.
66 The servant recounted to Isaac all the things he had done. 67 Then Isaac took Rebekah
into his tent; he married her, and thus she became his wife. In his love for her Isaac found solace
after the death of his mother Sarah.
Gen. 25
Abraham’s Sons by Keturah. 1 Abraham married another wife, whose name was Keturah.
2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3 Jokshan became the
father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the
Leummim. 4 The descendants of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of
these were descendants of Keturah.
5 Abraham deeded everything that he owned to his son Isaac. 6 To his sons by concubinage,
however, he made grants while he was still living, as he sent them away eastward, to the land of
Kedem, away from his son Isaac.
Death of Abraham. 7 The whole span of Abraham’s life was one hundred and seventy-five
years. 8 Then he breathed his last, dying at a ripe old age, grown old after a full life; and he was
taken to his kinsmen. 9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the
field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, which faces Mamre, 10 the field that Abraham had
bought from the Hittites; there he was buried next to his wife Sarah. 11 After the death of
Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac, who made his home near Beer-lahai-roi.
Descendants of Ishmael. 12 These are the descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom
Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave, bore to Abraham. 13 These are the names of Ishmael’s sons,
listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth (Ishmael’s firstborn), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14
Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 16 These are the sons
of Ishmael, their names by their villages and encampments; twelve chieftains of as many tribal
groups.
17 The span of Ishmael’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. After he had breathed
his last and died, he was taken to his kinsmen. 18 The Ishmaelites ranged from Havilah-by-Shur,
which is on the border of Egypt, all the way to Asshur; and each of them pitched camp in
opposition to his various kinsmen.
III. THE PATRIARCHS ISAAC AND JACOB
Birth of Esau and Jacob. 19 This is the family history of Isaac, son of Abraham; Abraham
had begotten Isaac. 20 Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of
Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean. 21 Isaac entreated
the LORD on behalf of his wife, since she was sterile. The LORD heard his entreaty, and
Rebekah became pregnant. 22 But the children in her womb jostled each other so much that she
exclaimed, “If this is to be so, what good will it do me!” She went to consult the LORD, 23 and
he answered her: “Two nations are in your womb, two peoples are quarreling while still within
you; But one shall surpass the other, and the older shall serve the younger.” 24 When the time of
her delivery came, there were twins in her womb. 25 The first to emerge was reddish, and his
whole body was like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau. 26 His brother came out next,
gripping Esau’s heel; so they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
27 As the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man who lived in the open;
whereas Jacob was a simple man, who kept to his tents. 28 Isaac preferred Esau, because he was
fond of game; but Rebekah preferred Jacob. 29 Once, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau
came in from the open, famished. 30 He said to Jacob, “Let me gulp down some of that red stuff;
I‘m starving.” (That is why he was called Edom.) 31 But Jacob replied, “First give me your
birthright in exchange for it.” 32 “Look,” said Esau, “I‘m on the point of dying. What good will
Books of Moses

23

any birthright do me?” 33 But Jacob insisted, “Swear to me first!” So he sold Jacob his birthright
under oath. 34 Jacob then gave him some bread and the lentil stew; and Esau ate, drank, got up,
and went his way. Esau cared little for his birthright.
Gen. 26
Isaac and Abimelech. 1 There was a famine in the land (distinct from the earlier one that
had occurred in the days of Abraham), and Isaac went down to Abimelech, king of the Philistines
in Gerar. 2 The LORD appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt, but continue to
camp wherever in this land I tell you. 3 Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you;
for to you and your descendants I will give all these lands, in fulfillment of the oath that I swore
to your father Abraham. 4 I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and
give them all these lands, and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find
blessing— 5 this because Abraham obeyed me, keeping my mandate (my commandments, my
ordinances, and my instructions).”
6 So Isaac settled in Gerar. 7 When the men of the place asked questions about his wife, he
answered, “She is my sister.” He was afraid, if he called her his wife, the men of the place would
kill him on account of Rebekah, since she was very beautiful. 8 But when he had been there for a
long time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, happened to look out of a window and was
surprised to see Isaac fondling his wife Rebekah. 9 He called for Isaac and said: “She must
certainly be your wife! How could you have said, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “I thought I
might lose my life on her account.” 10 “How could you do this to us!” exclaimed Abimelech. “It
would have taken very little for one of the men to lie with your wife, and you would have thus
brought guilt upon us!” 11 Abimelech therefore gave this warning to all his men: “Anyone who
molests this man or his wife shall forthwith be put to death.”
12 Isaac sowed a crop in that region and reaped a hundredfold the same year. Since the
LORD blessed him, 13 he became richer and richer all the time, until he was very wealthy
indeed. 14 He acquired such flocks and herds, and so many work animals, that the Philistines
became envious of him. 15 (The Philistines had stopped up and filled with dirt all the wells that
his father’s servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham.) 16 So Abimelech said to
Isaac, “Go away from us; you have become far too numerous for us.” 17 Isaac left there and
made the Wadi Gerar his regular campsite. 18 (Isaac reopened the wells which his father’s
servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham and which the Philistines had stopped
up after Abraham’s death; he gave them the same names that his father had given them.) 19 But
when Isaac’s servants dug in the wadi and reached spring water in their well, 20 the shepherds of
Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s servants, saying, “The water belongs to us!” So the well was called
Esek, because they had challenged him there. 21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled
over that one too; so it was called Sitnah. 22 When he had moved on from there, he dug still
another well; but over this one they did not quarrel. It was called Rehoboth, because he said,
“The LORD has now given us ample room, and we shall flourish in the land.”
23 From there Isaac went up to Beer-sheba. 24 The same night the LORD appeared to him
and said: “I am the God of your father Abraham. You have no need to fear, since I am with you.
I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.” 25 So he
built an altar there and invoked the LORD by name. After he had pitched his tent there, his
servants began to dig a well nearby.
26 Abimelech had meanwhile come to him from Gerar, accompanied by Ahuzzath, his
councilor, and Phicol, the general of his army. 27 Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me,
seeing that you hate me and have driven me away from you?” 28 They answered: “We are
convinced that the LORD is with you, so we propose that there be a sworn agreement between
our two sides—between you and us. Let us make a pact with you: 29 you shall not act unkindly
toward us, just as we have not molested you, but have always acted kindly toward you and have

let you depart in peace. Henceforth, ‘The LORD’S blessing be upon you!’” 30 Isaac then made a
feast for them, and they ate and drank. 31 Early the next morning they exchanged oaths. Then
Isaac bade them farewell, and they departed from him in peace.
32 That same day Isaac’s servants came and brought him news about the well they had been
digging; they told him, “We have reached water!” 33 He called it Shibah; hence the name of the
city, Beer-sheba, to this day.
34 When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hivite. 35 But they became a source of embitterment to Isaac
and Rebekah.
Gen. 27
Jacob’s Deception. 1 When Isaac was so old that his eyesight had failed him, he called his
older son Esau and said to him, “Son!” “Yes, father!” he replied. 2 Isaac then said, “As you can
see, I am so old that I may now die at any time. 3 Take your gear, therefore—your quiver and
bow—and go out into the country to hunt some game for me. 4 With your catch prepare an
appetizing dish for me, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my special
blessing before I die.”
5 Rebekah had been listening while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. So when Esau went
out into the country to hunt some game for his father, 6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Listen! I
overheard your father tell your brother Esau, 7 ‘Bring me some game and with it prepare an
appetizing dish for me to eat, that I may give you my blessing with the LORD’S approval before
I die.’ 8 Now, son, listen carefully to what I tell you. 9 Go to the flock and get me two choice
kids. With these I will prepare an appetizing dish for your father, such as he likes. 10 Then bring
it to your father to eat, that he may bless you before he dies.” 11 “But my brother Esau is a hairy
man,” said Jacob to his mother Rebekah, “and I am smooth-skinned! 12 Suppose my father feels
me? He will think I am making sport of him, and I shall bring on myself a curse instead of a
blessing.” 13 His mother, however, replied: “Let any curse against you, son, fall on me! Just do
as I say. Go and get me the kids.”
14 So Jacob went and got them and brought them to his mother; and with them she prepared
an appetizing dish, such as his father liked. 15 Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older
son Esau that she had in the house, and gave them to her younger son Jacob to wear; 16 and with
the skins of the kids she covered up his hands and the hairless parts of his neck. 17 Then she
handed her son Jacob the appetizing dish and the bread she had prepared.
18 Bringing them to his father, Jacob said, “Father!” “Yes?” replied Isaac. “Which of my
sons are you?” 19 Jacob answered his father: “I am Esau, your first-born. I did as you told me.
Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your special blessing.” 20 But
Isaac asked, “How did you succeed so quickly, son?” He answered, “The LORD, your God, let
things turn out well with me.” 21 Isaac then said to Jacob, “Come closer, son, that I may feel
you, to learn whether you really are my son Esau or not.” 22 So Jacob moved up closer to his
father. When Isaac felt him, he said, “Although the voice is Jacob’s, the hands are Esau’s.” 23
(He failed to identify him because his hands were hairy, like those of his brother Esau; so in the
end he gave him his blessing.) 24 Again he asked him, “Are you really my son Esau?”
“Certainly,” he replied. 25 Then Isaac said, “Serve me your game, son, that I may eat of it and
then give you my blessing.” Jacob served it to him, and Isaac ate; he brought him wine, and he
drank. 26 Finally his father Isaac said to him, “Come closer, son, and kiss me.” 27 As Jacob went
up and kissed him, Isaac smelled the fragrance of his clothes. With that, he blessed him, saying,
“Ah, the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a field that the LORD has blessed! 28 “May
God give to you of the dew of the heavens And of the fertility of the earth abundance of grain
and wine. 29 “Let peoples serve you, and nations pay you homage; Be master of your brothers,
and may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be
Books of Moses

25

those who bless you.”
30 Jacob had scarcely left his father, just after Isaac had finished blessing him, when his
brother Esau came back from his hunt. 31 Then he too prepared an appetizing dish with his
game, and bringing it to his father, he said, “Please, father, eat some of your son’s game, that you
may then give me your special blessing.” 32 “Who are you?” his father Isaac asked him. “I am
Esau,” he replied, “your first-born son.” 33 With that, Isaac was seized with a fit of
uncontrollable trembling. “Who was it, then,” he asked, “that hunted game and brought it to me?
I finished eating it just before you came, and I blessed him. Now he must remain blessed!” 34 On
hearing his father’s words, Esau burst into loud, bitter sobbing. “Father, bless me too!” he
begged. 35 When Isaac explained, “Your brother came here by a ruse and carried off your
blessing,” 36 Esau exclaimed, “He has been well named Jacob! He has now supplanted me
twice! First he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he
pleaded, “Haven‘t you saved a blessing for me?” 37 Isaac replied: “I have already appointed him
your master, and I have assigned to him all his kinsmen as his slaves; besides, I have enriched
him with grain and wine. What then can I do for you, son?” 38 But Esau urged his father, “Have
you only that one blessing, father? Bless me too!” Isaac, however, made no reply; and Esau wept
aloud. 39 Finally Isaac spoke again and said to him: “Ah, far from the fertile earth shall be your
dwelling; far from the dew of the heavens above! 40 “By your sword you shall live, and your
brother you shall serve; But when you become restive, you shall throw off his yoke from your
neck.”
41 Esau bore Jacob a grudge because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to
himself, “When the time of mourning for my father comes, I will kill my brother Jacob.” 42
When Rebekah got news of what her older son Esau had in mind, she called her younger son
Jacob and said to him: “Listen! Your brother Esau intends to settle accounts with you by killing
you. 43 Therefore, son, do what I tell you: flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran, 44 and stay
with him a while until your brother’s fury subsides 45 (until your brother’s anger against you
subsides) and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back. Must
I lose both of you in a single day?”
Jacob Sent to Laban. 46 Rebekah said to Isaac: “I am disgusted with life because of the
Hittite women. If Jacob also should marry a Hittite woman, a native of the land, like these
women, what good would life be to me?”
Gen. 28
1 Isaac therefore called Jacob, greeted him with a blessing, and charged him: “You shall not
marry a Canaanite woman! 2 Go now to Paddan-aram, to the home of your mother’s father
Bethuel, and there choose a wife for yourself from among the daughters of your uncle Laban. 3
May God Almighty bless you and make you fertile, multiply you that you may become an
assembly of peoples. 4 May he extend to you and your descendants the blessing he gave to
Abraham, so that you may gain possession of the land where you are staying, which he assigned
to Abraham.” 5 Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way; he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of
Bethuel the Aramean, and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
6 Esau noted that Isaac had blessed Jacob when he sent him to Paddan-aram to get himself a
wife there, charging him, as he gave him his blessing, not to marry a Canaanite woman, 7 and
that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram. 8 Esau realized how
displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac, 9 so he went to Ishmael, and in
addition to the wives he had, married Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael and
sister of Nebaioth.
Jacob’s Dream at Bethel. 10 Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and proceeded toward
Haran. 11 When he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there for
the night. Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep at
Books of Moses

26

that spot. 12 Then he had a dream: a stairway rested on the ground, with its top reaching to the
heavens; and God’s messengers were going up and down on it. 13 And there was the LORD
standing beside him and saying: “I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the
God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants. 14 These
shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth, and through them you shall spread out east and west,
north and south. In you and your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing. 15
Know that I am with you; I will protect you wherever you go, and bring you back to this land. I
will never leave you until I have done what I promised you.”
16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed, “Truly, the LORD is in this spot,
although I did not know it!” 17 In solemn wonder he cried out: “How awesome is this shrine!
This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven!” 18 Early the next
morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a memorial stone, and
poured oil on top of it. 19 He called that site Bethel, whereas the former name of the town had
been Luz.
20 Jacob then made this vow: “If God remains with me, to protect me on this journey I am
making and to give me enough bread to eat and clothing to wear, 21 and I come back safe to my
father’s house, the LORD shall be my God. 22 This stone that I have set up as a memorial stone
shall be God’s abode. Of everything you give me, I will faithfully return a tenth part to you.”
Gen. 29
Arrival in Haran. 1 After Jacob resumed his journey, he came to the land of the
Easterners. 2 Looking about, he saw a well in the open country, with three droves of sheep
huddled near it, for droves were watered from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the
well. 3 Only when all the shepherds were assembled there could they roll the stone away from
the mouth of the well and water the flocks. Then they would put the stone back again over the
mouth of the well.
4 Jacob said to them, “Friends, where are you from?” “We are from Haran,” they replied. 5
Then he asked them, “Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?” “We do,” they answered. 6 He
inquired further, “Is he well?” “He is,” they answered; “and here comes his daughter Rachel with
his flock.” 7 Then he said: “There is still much daylight left; it is hardly the time to bring the
animals home. Why don‘t you water the flocks now, and then continue pasturing them?” 8 “We
cannot,” they replied, “until all the shepherds are here to roll the stone away from the mouth of
the well; only then can we water the flocks.”
9 While he was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep; she was the
one who tended them. 10 As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, with the
sheep of his uncle Laban, he went up, rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well, and
watered his uncle’s sheep. 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and burst into tears. 12 He told her that
he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son, and she ran to tell her father. 13 When Laban heard
the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he hurried out to meet him. After embracing and kissing
him, he brought him to his house. Jacob then recounted to Laban all that had happened, 14 and
Laban said to him, “You are indeed my flesh and blood.”
Marriage to Leah and Rachel. After Jacob had stayed with him a full month, 15 Laban
said to him: “Should you serve me for nothing just because you are a relative of mine? Tell me
what your wages should be.” 16 Now Laban had two daughters; the older was called Leah, the
younger Rachel. 17 Leah had lovely eyes, but Rachel was well formed and beautiful. 18 Since
Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, he answered Laban, “I will serve you seven years for your
younger daughter Rachel.” 19 Laban replied, “I prefer to give her to you rather than to an
outsider. Stay with me.” 20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet they seemed to him but a
few days because of his love for her.
21 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, that I may consummate my marriage with
Books of Moses

27

her, for my term is now completed.” 22 So Laban invited all the local inhabitants and gave a
feast. 23 At nightfall he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob
consummated the marriage with her. 24 (Laban assigned his slave girl Zilpah to his daughter
Leah as her maidservant.) 25 In the morning Jacob was amazed: it was Leah! So he cried out to
Laban: “How could you do this to me! Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why did you
dupe me?” 26 “It is not the custom in our country,” Laban replied, “to marry off a younger
daughter before an older one. 27 Finish the bridal week for this one, and then I will give you the
other too, in return for another seven years of service with me.”
28 Jacob agreed. He finished the bridal week for Leah, and then Laban gave him his
daughter Rachel in marriage. 29 (Laban assigned his slave girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as
her maidservant.) 30 Jacob then consummated his marriage with Rachel also, and he loved her
more than Leah. Thus he remained in Laban’s service another seven years.
Jacob’s Children. 31 When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he made her fruitful,
while Rachel remained barren. 32 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben;
for she said, “It means, ‘The LORD saw my misery; now my husband will love me.’” 33 She
conceived again and bore a son, and said, “It means, ‘The LORD heard that I was unloved,’ and
therefore he has given me this one also”; so she named him Simeon. 34 Again she conceived and
bore a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, since I have now
borne him three sons”; that is why she named him Levi. 35 Once more she conceived and bore a
son, and she said, “This time I will give grateful praise to the LORD”; therefore she named him
Judah. Then she stopped bearing children.
Gen. 30
1 When Rachel saw that she failed to bear children to Jacob, she became envious of her
sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children or I shall die!” 2 In anger Jacob retorted, “Can I take
the place of God, who has denied you the fruit of the womb?” 3 She replied, “Here is my
maidservant Bilhah. Have intercourse with her, and let her give birth on my knees, so that I too
may have offspring, at least through her.” 4 So she gave him her maidservant Bilhah as a
consort, and Jacob had intercourse with her. 5 When Bilhah conceived and bore a son, 6 Rachel
said, “God has vindicated me; indeed he has heeded my plea and given me a son.” Therefore she
named him Dan. 7 Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah conceived again and bore a second son, 8 and
Rachel said, “I engaged in a fateful struggle with my sister, and I prevailed.” So she named him
Naphtali.
9 When Leah saw that she had ceased to bear children, she gave her maidservant Zilpah to
Jacob as a consort. 10 So Jacob had intercourse with Zilpah, and she conceived and bore a son.
11 Leah then said, “What good luck!” So she named him Gad. 12 Then Leah’s maidservant
Zilpah bore a second son to Jacob; 13 and Leah said, “What good fortune!”—meaning, “Women
call me fortunate.” So she named him Asher.
14 One day, during the wheat harvest, when Reuben was out in the field, he came upon
some mandrakes which he brought home to his mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, “Please let me
have some of your son’s mandrakes.” 15 Leah replied, “Was it not enough for you to take away
my husband, that you must now take my son’s mandrakes too?” “Very well, then!” Rachel
answered. “In exchange for your son’s mandrakes, Jacob may lie with you tonight.” 16 That
evening, when Jacob came home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You are now to
come in with me,” she told him, “because I have paid for you with my son’s mandrakes.” So that
night he slept with her, 17 and God heard her prayer; she conceived and bore a fifth son to Jacob.
18 Leah then said, “God has given me my reward for having let my husband have my
maidservant”; so she named him Issachar. 19 Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to
Jacob; 20 and she said, “God has brought me a precious gift. This time my husband will offer me
presents, now that I have borne him six sons”; so she named him Zebulun. 21 Finally, she gave
Books of Moses

28

birth to a daughter, and she named her Dinah.
22 Then God remembered Rachel; he heard her prayer and made her fruitful. 23 She
conceived and bore a son, and she said, “God has removed my disgrace.” 24 So she named him
Joseph, meaning, “May the LORD add another son to this one for me!”
Jacob Outwits Laban. 25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban: “Give me
leave to go to my homeland. 26 Let me have my wives, for whom I served you, and my children,
too, that I may depart. You know very well the service that I have rendered you.” 27 Laban
answered him: “If you will please...
“I have learned through divination that it is because of you that God has blessed me. 28 So,”
he continued, “state what wages you want from me, and I will pay them.” 29 Jacob replied: “You
know what work I did for you and how well your livestock fared under my care; 30 the little you
had before I came has grown into very much, since the LORD’S blessings came upon you in my
company. Therefore I should now do something for my own household as well.” 31 “What
should I pay you?” Laban asked. Jacob answered: “You do not have to pay me anything outright.
I will again pasture and tend your flock, if you do this one thing for me: 32 go through your
whole flock today and remove from it every dark animal among the sheep and every spotted or
speckled one among the goats. Only such animals shall be my wages. 33 In the future, whenever
you check on these wages of mine, let my honesty testify against me: any animal in my
possession that is not a speckled or spotted goat, or a dark sheep, got there by theft!” 34 “Very
well,” agreed Laban. “Let it be as you say.”
35 That same day Laban removed the streaked and spotted he-goats and all the speckled and
spotted she-goats, all those with some white on them, as well as the fully dark-colored sheep;
these he left...in charge of his sons. 36 Then he put a three days’ journey between himself and
Jacob, while Jacob continued to pasture the rest of Laban’s flock.
37 Jacob, however, got some fresh shoots of poplar, almond and plane trees, and he made
white stripes in them by peeling off the bark down to the white core of the shoots. 38 The rods
that he had thus peeled he then set upright in the watering troughs, so that they would be in front
of the animals that drank from the troughs. When the animals were in heat as they came to drink,
39 the goats mated by the rods, and so they brought forth streaked, speckled and spotted kids. 40
The sheep, on the other hand, Jacob kept apart, and he set these animals to face the streaked or
fully dark-colored animals of Laban. Thus he produced special flocks of his own, which he did
not put with Laban’s flock. 41 Moreover, whenever the hardier animals were in heat, Jacob
would set the rods in the troughs in full view of these animals, so that they mated by the rods; 42
but with the weaker animals he would not put the rods there. So the feeble animals would go to
Laban, but the sturdy ones to Jacob. 43 Thus the man grew increasingly prosperous, and he came
to own not only large flocks but also male and female servants and camels and asses.
Gen. 31
Flight from Laban. 1 Jacob learned that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken
everything that belonged to our father, and he has accumulated all this wealth of his by using our
father’s property.” 2 Jacob perceived, too, that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had
previously been. 3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, where you
were born, and I will be with you.”
4 So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him where he was in the field with his flock. 5
There he said to them: “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me is not as it was in the
past; but the God of my father has been with me. 6 You well know what effort I put into serving
your father; 7 yet your father cheated me and changed my wages time after time. God, however,
did not let him do me any harm. 8 Whenever your father said, ‘The speckled animals shall be
your wages,’ the entire flock would bear speckled young; whenever he said, ‘The streaked
animals shall be your wages,’ the entire flock would bear streaked young. 9 Thus God reclaimed
Books of Moses

29

your father’s livestock and gave it to me. 10 Once, in the breeding season, I had a dream in
which I saw mating he-goats that were streaked, speckled and mottled. 11 In the dream God’s
messenger called to me, ‘Jacob!’ ‘Here!’ I replied. 12 Then he said: ‘Note well. All the he-goats
in the flock, as they mate, are streaked, speckled and mottled, for I have seen all the things that
Laban has been doing to you. 13 I am the God who appeared to you in Bethel, where you
anointed a memorial stone and made a vow to me. Up, then! Leave this land and return to the
land of your birth.’”
14 Rachel and Leah answered him: “Have we still an heir’s portion in our father’s house? 15
Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? He not only sold us; he has even used up the money
that he got for us! 16 All the wealth that God reclaimed from our father really belongs to us and
our children. Therefore, do just as God has told you.” 17 Jacob proceeded to put his children and
wives on camels, 18 and he drove off with all his livestock and all the property he had acquired
in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
19 Now Laban had gone away to shear his sheep, and Rachel had meanwhile appropriated
her father’s household idols. 20 Jacob had hoodwinked Laban the Aramean by not telling him of
his intended flight. 21 Thus he made his escape with all that he had. Once he was across the
Euphrates, he headed for the highlands of Gilead.
22 On the third day, word came to Laban that Jacob had fled. 23 Taking his kinsmen with
him, he pursued him for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 24
But that night God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Take care not
to threaten Jacob with any harm!”
Jacob and Laban in Gilead. 25 When Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob’s tents were pitched in
the highlands; Laban also pitched his tents there, on Mount Gilead. 26 “What do you mean,”
Laban demanded of Jacob, “by hoodwinking me and carrying off my daughters like war
captives? 27 Why did you dupe me by stealing away secretly? You should have told me, and I
would have sent you off with merry singing to the sound of tambourines and harps. 28 You did
not even allow me a parting kiss to my daughters and grandchildren! What you have now done is
a senseless thing. 29 I have it in my power to harm all of you; but last night the God of your
father said to me, ‘Take care not to threaten Jacob with any harm!’ 30 Granted that you had to
leave because you were desperately homesick for your father’s house, why did you steal my
gods?” 31 “I was frightened,” Jacob replied to Laban, “at the thought that you might take your
daughters away from me by force. 32 But as for your gods, the one you find them with shall not
remain alive! If, with my kinsmen looking on, you identify anything here as belonging to you,
take it.” Jacob, of course, had no idea that Rachel had stolen the idols.
33 Laban then went in and searched Jacob’s tent and Leah’s tent, as well as the tents of the
two maidservants; but he did not find the idols. Leaving Leah’s tent, he went into Rachel’s. 34
Now Rachel had taken the idols, put them inside a camel cushion, and seated herself upon them.
When Laban had rummaged through the rest of her tent without finding them, 35 Rachel said to
her father, “Let not my lord feel offended that I cannot rise in your presence; a woman’s period
is upon me.” So, despite his search, he did not find his idols.
36 Jacob, now enraged, upbraided Laban. “What crime or offense have I committed,” he
demanded, “that you should hound me so fiercely? 37 Now that you have ransacked all my
things, have you found a single object taken from your belongings? If so, produce it here before
your kinsmen and mine, and let them decide between us two.
38 “In the twenty years that I was under you, no ewe or she-goat of yours ever miscarried,
and I have never feasted on a ram of your flock. 39 I never brought you an animal torn by wild
beasts; I made good the loss myself. You held me responsible for anything stolen by day or
night. 40 How often the scorching heat ravaged me by day, and the frost by night, while sleep
fled from my eyes! 41 Of the twenty years that I have now spent in your household, I slaved
fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, while you changed my wages

30

time after time. 42 If my ancestral God, the God of Abraham and the Awesome One of Isaac,
had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. But God saw my
plight and the fruits of my toil, and last night he gave judgment.”
43 Laban replied to Jacob: “The women are mine, their children are mine, and the flocks are
mine; everything you see belongs to me. But since these women are my daughters, I will now do
something for them and for the children they have borne. 44 Come, then, we will make a pact,
you and I; the LORD shall be a witness between us.”
45 Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial stone. 46 Jacob said to his kinsmen,
“Gather some stones.” So they got some stones and made a mound; and they had a meal there at
the mound. 47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed. 48 “This mound,”
said Laban, “shall be a witness from now on between you and me.” That is why it was named
Galeed— 49 and also Mizpah, for he said: “May the LORD keep watch between you and me
when we are out of each other’s sight. 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or take other wives
besides my daughters, remember that even though no one else is about, God will be witness
between you and me.”
51 Laban said further to Jacob: “Here is this mound, and here is the memorial stone that I
have set up between you and me. 52 This mound shall be witness, and this memorial stone shall
be witness, that, with hostile intent, neither may I pass beyond this mound into your territory, nor
may you pass beyond it into mine. 53 May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor (their
ancestral deities) maintain justice between us!” Jacob took the oath by the Awesome One of
Isaac. 54 He then offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his kinsmen to share in the
meal. When they had eaten, they passed the night on the mountain.
Gen. 32
1 Early the next morning, Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye; then
he set out on his journey back home, 2 while Jacob continued on his own way. Then God’s
messengers encountered Jacob. 3 When he saw them he said, “This is God’s encampment.” So
he named that place Mahanaim.
Embassy to Esau. 4 Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the
country of Edom, 5 with this message: “Thus shall you say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob
speaks as follows: I have been staying with Laban and have been detained there until now. 6 I
own cattle, asses and sheep, as well as male and female servants. I am sending my lord this
information in the hope of gaining your favor.’” 7 When the messengers returned to Jacob, they
said, “We reached your brother Esau. He is now coming to meet you, accompanied by four
hundred men.”
8 Jacob was very much frightened. In his anxiety, he divided the people who were with him,
as well as his flocks, herds and camels, into two camps. 9 “If Esau should attack and overwhelm
one camp,” he reasoned, “the remaining camp may still survive.” 10 Then he prayed: “O God of
my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac! You told me, O LORD, ‘Go back to the land of
your birth, and I will be good to you.’ 11 I am unworthy of all the acts of kindness that you have
loyally performed for your servant: although I crossed the Jordan here with nothing but my staff,
I have now grown into two companies. 12 Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau!
Otherwise I fear that when he comes he will strike me down and slay the mothers and children.
13 You yourself said, ‘I will be very good to you, and I will make your descendants like the
sands of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”
14 After passing the night there, Jacob selected from what he had with him the following
presents for his brother Esau: 15 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats; two hundred ewes
and twenty rams; 16 thirty milch camels and their young; forty cows and ten bulls; twenty sheasses and ten he-asses. 17 He put these animals in charge of his servants, in separate droves, and
he told the servants, “Go on ahead of me, but keep a space between one drove and the next.” 18
Books of Moses

31

To the servant in the lead he gave this instruction: “When my brother Esau meets you, he may
ask you, ‘Whose man are you? Where are you going? To whom do these animals ahead of you
belong?’ 19 Then you shall answer, ‘They belong to your brother Jacob, but they have been sent
as a gift to my lord Esau; and Jacob himself is right behind us.’” 20 He gave similar instructions
to the second servant and the third and to all the others who followed behind the droves, namely:
“Thus and thus shall you say to Esau, when you reach him; 21 and be sure to add, ‘Your servant
Jacob is right behind us.’” For Jacob reasoned, “If I first appease him with gifts that precede me,
then later, when I face him, perhaps he will forgive me.” 22 So the gifts went on ahead of him,
while he stayed that night in the camp.
Struggle with the Angel. 23 In the course of that night, however, Jacob arose, took his two
wives, with the two maidservants and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 24
After he had taken them across the stream and had brought over all his possessions, 25 Jacob was
left there alone. Then some man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. 26 When the man
saw that he could not prevail over him, he struck Jacob’s hip at its socket, so that the hip socket
was wrenched as they wrestled. 27 The man then said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob
said, “I will not let you go until you bless me.” 28 “What is your name?” the man asked. He
answered, “Jacob.” 29 Then the man said, “You shall no longer be spoken of as Jacob, but as
Israel, because you have contended with divine and human beings and have prevailed.” 30 Jacob
then asked him, “Do tell me your name, please.” He answered, “Why should you want to know
my name?” With that, he bade him farewell. 31 Jacob named the place Peniel, “Because I have
seen God face to face,” he said, “yet my life has been spared.”
32 At sunrise, as he left Penuel, Jacob limped along because of his hip. 33 That is why, to
this day, the Israelites do not eat the sciatic muscle that is on the hip socket, inasmuch as Jacob’s
hip socket was struck at the sciatic muscle.
Gen. 33
Jacob and Esau Meet. 1 Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, accompanied by four
hundred men. So he divided his children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants, 2
putting the maids and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
3 He himself went on ahead of them, bowing to the ground seven times, until he reached his
brother. 4 Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and flinging himself on his neck, kissed him as
he wept.
5 When Esau looked about, he saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he
asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children whom God has graciously bestowed on your
servant.” 6 Then the maidservants and their children came forward and bowed low; 7 next, Leah
and her children came forward and bowed low; lastly, Rachel and her children came forward and
bowed low. 8 Then Esau asked, “What did you intend with all those droves that I encountered?”
Jacob answered, “It was to gain my lord’s favor.” 9 “I have plenty,” replied Esau; “you should
keep what is yours, brother.” 10 “No, I beg you!” said Jacob. “If you will do me the favor, please
accept this gift from me, since to come into your presence is for me like coming into the
presence of God, now that you have received me so kindly. 11 Do accept the present I have
brought you; God has been generous toward me, and I have an abundance.” Since he so urged
him, Esau accepted.
12 Then Esau said, “Let us break camp and be on our way; I will travel alongside you.” 13
But Jacob replied: “As my lord can see, the children are frail. Besides, I am encumbered with the
flocks and herds, which now have sucklings; if overdriven for a single day, the whole flock will
die. 14 Let my lord, then, go on ahead of me, while I proceed more slowly at the pace of the
livestock before me and at the pace of my children, until I join my lord in Seir.” 15 Esau replied,
“Let me at least put at your disposal some of the men who are with me.” But Jacob said, “For
what reason? Please indulge me in this, my lord.” 16 So on the same day that Esau began his
Books of Moses

32

journey back to Seir, 17 Jacob journeyed to Succoth. There he built a home for himself and made
booths for his livestock. That is why the place was called Succoth.
18 Having thus come from Paddan-aram, Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem, which
is in the land of Canaan, and he encamped in sight of the city. 19 The plot of ground on which he
had pitched his tent he bought for a hundred pieces of bullion from the descendants of Hamor,
the founder of Shechem. 20 He set up a memorial stone there and invoked “El, the God of
Israel.”
Gen. 34
The Rape of Dinah. 1 Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to
visit some of the women of the land. 2 When Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, who was chief
of the region, saw her, he seized her and lay with her by force. 3 Since he was strongly attracted
to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, indeed was really in love with the girl, he endeavored to win her
affection. 4 Shechem also asked his father Hamor, “Get me this girl for a wife.”
5 Meanwhile, Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah; but since his sons
were out in the fields with his livestock, he held his peace until they came home. 6 Now Hamor,
the father of Shechem, went out to discuss the matter with Jacob, 7 just as Jacob’s sons were
coming in from the fields. When they heard the news, the men were shocked and seethed with
indignation. What Shechem had done was an outrage in Israel; such a thing could not be
tolerated.
8 Hamor appealed to them, saying: “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter.
Please give her to him in marriage. 9 Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our
daughters for yourselves. 10 Thus you can live among us. The land is open before you; you can
settle and move about freely in it, and acquire landed property here.” 11 Then Shechem, too,
appealed to Dinah’s father and brothers: “Do me this favor, and I will pay whatever you demand
of me. 12 No matter how high you set the bridal price, I will pay you whatever you ask; only
give me the maiden in marriage.”
Revenge of Jacob’s Sons. 13 Jacob’s sons replied to Shechem and his father Hamor with
guile, speaking as they did because their sister Dinah had been defiled. 14 “We could not do such
a thing,” they said, “as to give our sister to an uncircumcised man; that would be a disgrace for
us. 15 We will agree with you only on this condition, that you become like us by having every
male among you circumcised. 16 Then we will give you our daughters and take yours in
marriage; we will settle among you and become one kindred people with you. 17 But if you do
not comply with our terms regarding circumcision, we will take our daughter and go away.”
18 Their proposal seemed fair to Hamor and his son Shechem. 19 The young man lost no
time in acting in the matter, since he was deeply in love with Jacob’s daughter. Moreover he was
more highly respected than anyone else in his clan. 20 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to
their town council and thus presented the matter to their fellow townsmen: 21 “These men are
friendly toward us. Let them settle in the land and move about in it freely; there is ample room in
the country for them. We can marry their daughters and give our daughters to them in marriage.
22 But the men will agree to live with us and form one kindred people with us only on this
condition, that every male among us be circumcised as they themselves are. 23 Would not the
livestock they have acquired—all their animals—then be ours? Let us, therefore, give in to them,
so that they may settle among us.”
24 All the able-bodied men of the town agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and all the
males, including every able-bodied man in the community, were circumcised. 25 On the third
day, while they were still in pain, Dinah’s full brothers Simeon and Levi, two of Jacob’s sons,
took their swords, advanced against the city without any trouble, and massacred all the males. 26
After they had put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, they took Dinah from Shechem’s
house and left. 27 Then the other sons of Jacob followed up the slaughter and sacked the city in
Books of Moses

33

reprisal for their sister Dinah’s defilement. 28 They seized their flocks, herds and asses, whatever
was in the city and in the country around. 29 They carried off all their wealth, their women, and
their children, and took for loot whatever was in the houses.
30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: “You have brought trouble upon me by making me
loathsome to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I have so few men
that, if these people unite against me and attack me, I and my family will be wiped out.” 31 But
they retorted, “Should our sister have been treated like a harlot?”
Gen. 35
Bethel Revisited. 1 God said to Jacob: “Go up now to Bethel. Settle there and build an altar
there to the God who appeared to you while you were fleeing from your brother Esau.” 2 So
Jacob told his family and all the others who were with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that you
have among you; then purify yourselves and put on fresh clothes. 3 We are now to go up to
Bethel, and I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my hour of distress and
who has been with me wherever I have gone.” 4 They therefore handed over to Jacob all the
foreign gods in their possession and also the rings they had in their ears. 5 Then, as they set out,
a terror from God fell upon the towns round about, so that no one pursued the sons of Jacob.
6 Thus Jacob and all the people who were with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the
land of Canaan. 7 There he built an altar and named the place Bethel, for it was there that God
had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
8 Death came to Rebekah’s nurse Deborah; she was buried under the oak below Bethel, and
so it was called Allonbacuth.
9 On Jacob’s arrival from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 10
God said to him: “You whose name is Jacob shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be
your name.”
Thus he was named Israel. 11 God also said to him: “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and
multiply. A nation, indeed an assembly of nations, shall stem from you, and kings shall issue
from your loins. 12 The land I once gave to Abraham and Isaac I now give to you; And to your
descendants after you will I give this land.”
13 Then God departed from him. 14 On the site where God had spoken with him, Jacob set
up a memorial stone, and upon it he made a libation and poured out oil. 15 Jacob named the site
Bethel, because God had spoken with him there.
Jacob’s Family. 16 Then they departed from Bethel; but while they still had some distance
to go on the way to Ephrath, Rachel began to be in labor and to suffer great distress. 17 When
her pangs were most severe, her midwife said to her, “Have no fear! This time, too, you have a
son.” 18 With her last breath—for she was at the point of death - she called him Ben-oni; his
father, however, named him Benjamin. 19 Thus Rachel died; and she was buried on the road to
Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 20 Jacob set up a memorial stone on her grave, and the same
monument marks Rachel’s grave to this day.
21 Israel moved on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-eder. 22 While Israel was encamped
in that region, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine. When Israel heard of it,
he was greatly offended.
The sons of Jacob were now twelve. 23 The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born,
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
25 the sons of Rachel’s maid Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali; 26 the sons of Leah’s maid Zilpah: Gad
and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
27 Jacob went home to his father Isaac at Mamre, in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where
Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 28 The lifetime of Isaac was one hundred and eighty years;
29 then he breathed his last. After a full life, he died as an old man and was taken to his kinsmen.
His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

Gen. 36
Edomite Lists. 1 These are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom). 2 Esau took his wives
from among the Canaanite women: Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah,
granddaughter through Anah of Zibeon the Hivite; 3 and Basemath, daughter of Ishmael and
sister of Nebaioth. 4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; Basemath bore Reuel; 5 and Oholibamah bore
Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
6 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, as well
as his livestock comprising various animals and all the property he had acquired in the land of
Canaan, and went to the land of Seir, out of the way of his brother Jacob. 7 Their possessions had
become too great for them to dwell together, and the land in which they were staying could not
support them because of their livestock. 8 So Esau settled in the highlands of Seir. (Esau is
Edom.) 9 These are the descendants of Esau, ancestor of the Edomites, in the highlands of Seir.
10 These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, son of Esau’s wife Adah; and Reuel, son of
Esau’s wife Basemath. 11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
12 (Esau’s son Eliphaz had a concubine Timna, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These are the
descendants of Esau’s wife Adah. 13 The sons of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and
Mizzah. These are the descendants of Esau’s wife Basemath. 14 The descendants of Esau’s wife
Oholibamah—granddaughter through Anah of Zibeon—whom she bore to Esau were Jeush,
Jalam, and Korah.
15 The following are the clans of Esau’s descendants. The descendants of Eliphaz, Esau’s
first-born: the clans of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are
the clans of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are descended from Adah. 17 The descendants of
Esau’s son Reuel: the clans of Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the clans of
Reuel in the land of Edom; they are descended from Esau’s wife Basemath. 18 The descendants
of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: the clans of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the clans of Esau’s
wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah. 19 Such are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom)
according to their clans.
20 The following are the descendants of Seir the Horite, the original settlers in the land:
Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; they are the Horite clans descended
from Seir, in the land of Edom. 22 Lotan’s descendants were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan’s
sister was Timna. 23 Shobal’s descendants were Alvan, Mahanath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 24
Zibeon’s descendants were Aiah and Anah. (He is the Anah who found water in the desert while
he was pasturing the asses of his father Zibeon.) 25 The descendants of Anah were Dishon and
Oholibamah, daughter of Anah. 26 The descendants of Dishon were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran,
and Cheran. 27 The descendants of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 28 The descendants of
Dishan were Uz and Aran. 29 These are the Horite clans: the clans of Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon,
Anah, 30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; they were the clans of the Horites, clan by clan, in the land
of Seir.
31 The following are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned
over the Israelites. 32 Bela, son of Beor, became king in Edom; the name of his city was
Dinhabah. 33 When Bela died, Jobab, son of Zerah, from Bozrah, succeeded him as king. 34
When Jobab died, Husham, from the land of the Temanites, succeeded him as king. He defeated
the Midianites in the country of Moab; the name of his city was Avith. 35 When Husham died,
Hadad, son of Bedad, succeeded him as king. 36 When Hadad died, Samlah, from Masrekah,
succeeded him as king. 37 When Samlah died, Shaul, from Rehoboth-on-the-River, succeeded
him as king. 38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan, son of Achbor, succeeded him as king. 39 When
Baal-hanan died, Hadar succeeded him as king; the name of his city was Pau. (His wife’s name
was Mehetabel; she was the daughter of Matred, son of Mezahab.)
40 The following are the names of the clans of Esau individually according to their
subdivisions and localities: the clans of Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 42

35

Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 43 Magdiel, and Iram. These are the clans of the Edomites, according to
their settlements in their territorial holdings. (Esau was the father of the Edomites.)
IV. JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS
Gen. 37
Joseph Sold into Egypt. 1 Jacob settled in the land where his father had stayed, the land of
Canaan. 2 This is his family history. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he was tending the
flocks with his brothers; he was an assistant to the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah,
and he brought his father bad reports about them.
3 Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons, for he was the child of his old age; and he had
made him a long tunic. 4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him best of all his sons,
they hated him so much that they would not even greet him.
5 Once Joseph had a dream, which he told to his brothers: 6 “Listen to this dream I had. 7
There we were, binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf rose to an upright position,
and your sheaves formed a ring around my sheaf and bowed down to it.” 8 “Are you really going
to make yourself king over us?” his brothers asked him. “Or impose your rule on us?” So they
hated him all the more because of his talk about his dreams.
9 Then he had another dream, and this one, too, he told to his brothers. “I had another
dream,” he said; “this time, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 10
When he also told it to his father, his father reproved him. “What is the meaning of this dream of
yours?” he asked. “Can it be that I and your mother and your brothers are to come and bow to the
ground before you?” 11 So his brothers were wrought up against him but his father pondered the
matter.
12 One day, when his brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks at Shechem, 13
Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers, you know, are tending our flocks at Shechem. Get ready; I
will send you to them.” “I am ready,” Joseph answered. 14 “Go then,” he replied; “see if all is
well with your brothers and the flocks, and bring back word.” So he sent him off from the valley
of Hebron. When Joseph reached Shechem, 15 a man met him as he was wandering about in the
fields. “What are you looking for?” the man asked him. 16 “I am looking for my brothers,” he
answered. “Could you please tell me where they are tending the flocks?” 17 The man told him,
“They have moved on from here; in fact, I heard them say, ‘Let us go on to Dothan.’” So Joseph
went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan. 18 They noticed him from a distance,
and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him. 19 They said to one another: “Here
comes that master dreamer! 20 Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns
here; we could say that a wild beast devoured him. We shall then see what comes of his dreams.”
21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him from their hands, saying: “We must not
take his life. 22 Instead of shedding blood,” he continued, “just throw him into that cistern there
in the desert; but don‘t kill him outright.” His purpose was to rescue him from their hands and
restore him to his father. 23 So when Joseph came up to them, they stripped him of the long tunic
he had on; 24 then they took him and threw him into the cistern, which was empty and dry.
25 They then sat down to their meal. Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming
from Gilead, their camels laden with gum, balm and resin to be taken down to Egypt. 26 Judah
said to his brothers: “What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood? 27
Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites, instead of doing away with him ourselves. After all,
he is our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers agreed. 28 They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for
twenty pieces of silver.
Some Midianite traders passed by, and they pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and took him
to Egypt. 29 When Reuben went back to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not in it, he tore his
clothes, 30 and returning to his brothers, he exclaimed: “The boy is gone! And I—where can I
turn?” 31 They took Joseph’s tunic, and after slaughtering a goat, dipped the tunic in its blood.
Books of Moses

36

32 Then they sent someone to bring the long tunic to their father, with the message: “We found
this. See whether it is your son’s tunic or not.” 33 He recognized it and exclaimed: “My son’s
tunic! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph has been torn to pieces!” 34 Then Jacob rent his
clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned his son many days. 35 Though his sons and
daughters tried to console him, he refused all consolation, saying, “No, I will go down mourning
to my son in the nether world.” Thus did his father lament him.
36 The Midianites, meanwhile, sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and
his chief steward.
Gen. 38
Judah and Tamar. 1 About that time Judah parted from his brothers and pitched his tent
near a certain Adullamite named Hirah. 2 There he met the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua,
married her, and had relations with her. 3 She conceived and bore a son, whom she named Er. 4
Again she conceived and bore a son, whom she named Onan. 5 Then she bore still another son,
whom she named Shelah. They were in Chezib when he was born.
6 Judah got a wife named Tamar for his first-born, Er. 7 But Er, Judah’s first-born, greatly
offended the LORD; so the LORD took his life. 8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Unite with your
brother’s widow, in fulfillment of your duty as brother-in-law, and thus preserve your brother’s
line.” 9 Onan, however, knew that the descendants would not be counted as his; so whenever he
had relations with his brother’s widow, he wasted his seed on the ground, to avoid contributing
offspring for his brother. 10 What he did greatly offended the LORD, and the LORD took his life
too. 11 Thereupon Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Stay as a widow in your father’s
house until my son Shelah grows up”—for he feared that Shelah also might die like his brothers.
So Tamar went to live in her father’s house.
12 Years passed, and Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. After Judah completed the
period of mourning, he went up to Timnah for the shearing of his sheep, in company with his
friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13 When Tamar was told that her father-in-law was on his way up
to Timnah to shear his sheep, 14 she took off her widow’s garb, veiled her face by covering
herself with a shawl, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for
she was aware that, although Shelah was now grown up, she had not been given to him in
marriage. 15 When Judah saw her, he mistook her for a harlot, since she had covered her face. 16
So he went over to her at the roadside, and not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he
said, “Come, let me have intercourse with you.” She replied, “What will you pay me for letting
you have intercourse with me?” 17 He answered, “I will send you a kid from the flock.” “Very
well,” she said, “provided you leave a pledge until you send it.” 18 Judah asked, “What pledge
am I to give to you?” She answered, “Your seal and cord, and the staff you carry.” So he gave
them to her and had intercourse with her, and she conceived by him. 19 When she went away,
she took off her shawl and put on her widow’s garb again.
20 Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite to recover the pledge from the woman;
but he could not find her. 21 So he asked the men of the place, “Where is the temple prostitute,
the one by the roadside in Enaim?” But they answered, “There has never been a temple prostitute
here.” 22 He went back to Judah and told him, “I could not find her; and besides, the men of the
place said there was no temple prostitute there.” 23 “Let her keep the things,” Judah replied;
“otherwise we shall become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her the kid, even though you
were unable to find her.”
24 About three months later, Judah was told that his daughter-in-law Tamar had played the
harlot and was then with child from her harlotry. “Bring her out,” cried Judah; “she shall be
burned.” 25 But as they were bringing her out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “It is by the
man to whom these things belong that I am with child. Please verify,” she added, “whose seal
and cord and whose staff these are.” 26 Judah recognized them and said, “She is more in the
Books of Moses

37

right than I am, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” But he had no further relations with
her.
27 When the time of her delivery came, she was found to have twins in her womb. 28 While
she was giving birth, one infant put out his hand; and the midwife, taking a crimson thread, tied
it on his hand, to note that this one came out first. 29 But as he withdrew his hand, his brother
came out; and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was called Perez. 30
Afterward his brother came out; he was called Zerah.
Gen. 39
Joseph’s Temptation. 1 When Joseph was taken down to Egypt, a certain Egyptian
(Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and his chief steward) bought him from the Ishmaelites who had
brought him there. 2 But since the LORD was with him, Joseph got on very well and was
assigned to the household of his Egyptian master. 3 When his master saw that the LORD was
with him and brought him success in whatever he did, 4 he took a liking to Joseph and made him
his personal attendant; he put him in charge of his household and entrusted to him all his
possessions. 5 From the moment that he put him in charge of his household and all his
possessions, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; in fact, the LORD’S
blessing was on everything he owned, both inside the house and out. 6 Having left everything he
owned in Joseph’s charge, he gave no thought, with Joseph there, to anything but the food he ate.
Now Joseph was strikingly handsome in countenance and body. 7 After a time, his master’s
wife began to look fondly at him and said, “Lie with me.” 8 But he refused. “As long as I am
here,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, but has
entrusted to me all he owns. 9 He wields no more authority in this house than I do, and he has
withheld from me nothing but yourself, since you are his wife. How, then, could I commit so
great a wrong and thus stand condemned before God?” 10 Although she tried to entice him day
after day, he would not agree to lie beside her, or even stay near her.
11 One such day, when Joseph came into the house to do his work, and none of the
household servants were then in the house, 12 she laid hold of him by his cloak, saying, “Lie
with me!” But leaving the cloak in her hand, he got away from her and ran outside. 13 When she
saw that he had left his cloak in her hand as he fled outside, 14 she screamed for her household
servants and told them, “Look! my husband has brought in a Hebrew slave to make sport of us!
He came in here to lie with me, but I cried out as loud as I could. 15 When he heard me scream
for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran away outside.”
16 She kept the cloak with her until his master came home. 17 Then she told him the same
story: “The Hebrew slave whom you brought here broke in on me, to make sport of me. 18 But
when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and fled outside.” 19 As soon as the master
heard his wife’s story about how his slave had treated her, he became enraged. 20 He seized
Joseph and threw him into the jail where the royal prisoners were confined.
But even while he was in prison, 21 the LORD remained with Joseph; he showed him
kindness by making the chief jailer well-disposed toward him. 22 The chief jailer put Joseph in
charge of all the prisoners in the jail, and everything that had to be done there was done under his
management. 23 The chief jailer did not concern himself with anything at all that was in Joseph’s
charge, since the LORD was with him and brought success to all he did.
Gen. 40
The Dreams Interpreted. 1 Some time afterward, the royal cupbearer and baker gave
offense to their lord, the king of Egypt. 2 Pharaoh was angry with his two courtiers, the chief
cupbearer and the chief baker, 3 and he put them in custody in the house of the chief steward (the
same jail where Joseph was confined). 4 The chief steward assigned Joseph to them, and he
became their attendant.
Books of Moses

38

After they had been in custody for some time, 5 the cupbearer and the baker of the king of
Egypt who were confined in the jail both had dreams on the same night, each dream with its own
meaning. 6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he noticed that they looked disturbed. 7
So he asked Pharaoh’s courtiers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why do
you look so sad today?” 8 They answered him, “We have had dreams, but there is no one to
interpret them for us.” Joseph said to them, “Surely, interpretations come from God. Please tell
the dreams to me.”
9 Then the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. “In my dream,” he said, “I saw a vine in
front of me, 10 and on the vine were three branches. It had barely budded when its blossoms
came out, and its clusters ripened into grapes. 11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; so I took the
grapes, pressed them out into his cup, and put it in Pharaoh’s hand.” 12 Joseph said to him: “This
is what it means. The three branches are three days; 13 within three days Pharaoh will lift up
your head and restore you to your post. You will be handing Pharaoh his cup as you formerly
used to do when you were his cupbearer. 14 So if you will still remember, when all is well with
you, that I was here with you, please do me the favor of mentioning me to Pharaoh, to get me out
of this place. 15 The truth is that I was kidnaped from the land of the Hebrews, and here I have
not done anything for which I should have been put into a dungeon.”
16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given this favorable interpretation, he said to
him: “I too had a dream. In it I had three wicker baskets on my head; 17 in the top one were all
kinds of bakery products for Pharaoh, but the birds were pecking at them out of the basket on my
head.” 18 Joseph said to him in reply: “This is what it means. The three baskets are three days;
19 within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and have you impaled on a stake, and the
birds will be pecking the flesh from your body.”
20 And in fact, on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, when he gave a banquet to
all his staff, with his courtiers around him, he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and chief
baker. 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, so that he again handed the cup to
Pharaoh; 22 but the chief baker he impaled - just as Joseph had told them in his interpretation. 23
Yet the chief cupbearer gave no thought to Joseph; he had forgotten him.
Gen. 41
Pharaoh’s Dreams. 1 After a lapse of two years, Pharaoh had a dream. He saw himself
standing by the Nile, 2 when up out of the Nile came seven cows, handsome and fat; they grazed
in the reed grass. 3 Behind them seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile; and
standing on the bank of the Nile beside the others, 4 the ugly, gaunt cows ate up the seven
handsome, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
5 He fell asleep again and had another dream. He saw seven ears of grain, fat and healthy,
growing on a single stalk. 6 Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and blasted by the
east wind; 7 and the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven fat, healthy ears. Then Pharaoh
woke up, to find it was only a dream.
8 Next morning his spirit was agitated. So he summoned all the magicians and sages of
Egypt and recounted his dreams to them; but no one could interpret his dreams for him. 9 Then
the chief cupbearer spoke up and said to Pharaoh: “On this occasion I am reminded of my
negligence. 10 Once, when Pharaoh was angry, he put me and the chief baker in custody in the
house of the chief steward. 11 Later, we both had dreams on the same night, and each of our
dreams had its own meaning. 12 There with us was a Hebrew youth, a slave of the chief steward;
and when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us and explained for each of us the
meaning of his dream. 13 And it turned out just as he had told us: I was restored to my post, but
the other man was impaled.”
14 Pharaoh therefore had Joseph summoned, and they hurriedly brought him from the
dungeon. After he shaved and changed his clothes, he came into Pharaoh’s presence. 15 Pharaoh
Books of Moses

39

then said to him: “I had certain dreams that no one can interpret. But I hear it said of you that the
moment you are told a dream you can interpret it.” 16 “It is not I,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh,
“but God who will give Pharaoh the right answer.”
17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 18
when up from the Nile came seven cows, fat and well-formed; they grazed in the reed grass. 19
Behind them came seven other cows, scrawny, most ill-formed and gaunt. Never have I seen
such ugly specimens as these in all the land of Egypt! 20 The gaunt, ugly cows ate up the first
seven fat cows. 21 But when they had consumed them, no one could tell that they had done so,
because they looked as ugly as before. Then I woke up. 22 In another dream I saw seven ears of
grain, fat and healthy, growing on a single stalk. 23 Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain,
shriveled and thin and blasted by the east wind; 24 and the seven thin ears swallowed up the
seven healthy ears. I have spoken to the magicians, but none of them can give me an
explanation.”
25 Joseph said to Pharaoh: “Both of Pharaoh’s dreams have the same meaning. God has thus
foretold to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26 The seven healthy cows are seven years, and the
seven healthy ears are seven years—the same in each dream. 27 So also, the seven thin, ugly
cows that came up after them are seven years, as are the seven thin, wind-blasted ears; they are
seven years of famine. 28 It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is
about to do. 29 Seven years of great abundance are now coming throughout the land of Egypt; 30
but these will be followed by seven years of famine, when all the abundance in the land of Egypt
will be forgotten. When the famine has ravaged the land, 31 no trace of the abundance will be
found in the land because of the famine that follows it—so utterly severe will that famine be. 32
That Pharaoh had the same dream twice means that the matter has been reaffirmed by God and
that God will soon bring it about.
33 “Therefore, let Pharaoh seek out a wise and discerning man and put him in charge of the
land of Egypt. 34 Pharaoh should also take action to appoint overseers, so as to regiment the land
during the seven years of abundance. 35 They should husband all the food of the coming good
years, collecting the grain under Pharaoh’s authority, to be stored in the towns for food. 36 This
food will serve as a reserve for the country against the seven years of famine that are to follow in
the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”
37 This advice pleased Pharaoh and all his officials. 38 “Could we find another like him,”
Pharaoh asked his officials, “a man so endowed with the spirit of God?” 39 So Pharaoh said to
Joseph: “Since God has made all this known to you, no one can be as wise and discerning as you
are. 40 You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people shall dart at your command. Only
in respect to the throne shall I outrank you. 41 Herewith,” Pharaoh told Joseph, “I place you in
charge of the whole land of Egypt.” 42 With that, Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on
Joseph’s finger. He had him dressed in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. 43
He then had him ride in the chariot of his vizier, and they shouted “Abrek!” before him.
Thus was Joseph installed over the whole land of Egypt. 44 “I, Pharaoh, proclaim,” he told
Joseph, “that without your approval no one shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” 45
Pharaoh also bestowed the name of Zaphnath-paneah on Joseph, and he gave him in marriage
Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis. 46 Joseph was thirty years old when he
entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
After Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence, he traveled throughout the land of Egypt. 47 During
the seven years of plenty, when the land produced abundant crops, 48 he husbanded all the food
of these years of plenty that the land of Egypt was enjoying and stored it in the towns, placing in
each town the crops of the fields around it. 49 Joseph garnered grain in quantities like the sands
of the sea, so vast that at last he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.
50 Before the famine years set in, Joseph became the father of two sons, borne to him by
Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis. 51 He named his first-born Manasseh,
Books of Moses

40

meaning, “God has made me forget entirely the sufferings I endured at the hands of my family”;
52 and the second he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my
affliction.”
53 When the seven years of abundance enjoyed by the land of Egypt came to an end, 54 the
seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had predicted. Although there was famine in all the
other countries, food was available throughout the land of Egypt. 55 When hunger came to be
felt throughout the land of Egypt and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh directed all
the Egyptians to go to Joseph and do whatever he told them. 56 When the famine had spread
throughout the land, Joseph opened all the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians,
since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt. 57 In fact, all the world came to Joseph to obtain
rations of grain, for famine had gripped the whole world.
Gen. 42
The Brothers’ First Journey to Egypt. 1 When Jacob learned that grain rations were
available in Egypt, he said to his sons: “Why do you keep gaping at one another? 2 I hear,” he
went on, “that rations of grain are available in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, that
we may stay alive rather than die of hunger.” 3 So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy an
emergency supply of grain from Egypt. 4 It was only Joseph’s full brother Benjamin that Jacob
did not send with the rest, for he thought some disaster might befall him. 5 Thus, since there was
famine in the land of Canaan also, the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure
rations.
6 It was Joseph, as governor of the country, who dispensed the rations to all the people.
When Joseph’s brothers came and knelt down before him with their faces to the ground, 7 he
recognized them as soon as he saw them. But he concealed his own identity from them and spoke
sternly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked them. They answered, “From the land of
Canaan, to procure food.”
8 When Joseph recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him, 9 he was
reminded of the dreams he had about them. He said to them: “You are spies. You have come to
see the nakedness of the land.” 10 “No, my lord,” they replied. “On the contrary, your servants
have come to procure food. 11 All of us are sons of the same man. We are honest men; your
servants have never been spies.” 12 But he answered them: “Not so! You have come to see the
nakedness of the land.” 13 “We your servants,” they said, “were twelve brothers, sons of a
certain man in Canaan; but the youngest one is at present with our father, and the other one is
gone.” 14 “It is just as I said,” Joseph persisted; “you are spies. 15 This is how you shall be
tested: unless your youngest brother comes here, I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you shall not
leave here. 16 So send one of your number to get your brother, while the rest of you stay here
under arrest. Thus shall your words be tested for their truth; if they are untrue, as Pharaoh lives,
you are spies!” 17 With that, he locked them up in the guardhouse for three days.
18 On the third day Joseph said to them: “Do this, and you shall live; for I am a God-fearing
man. 19 If you have been honest, only one of your brothers need be confined in this prison, while
the rest of you may go and take home provisions for your starving families. 20 But you must
come back to me with your youngest brother. Your words will thus be verified, and you will not
die.” To this they agreed. 21 To one another, however, they said: “Alas, we are being punished
because of our brother. We saw the anguish of his heart when he pleaded with us, yet we paid no
heed; that is why this anguish has now come upon us.” 22 “Didn‘t I tell you,” broke in Reuben,
“not to do wrong to the boy? But you wouldn‘t listen! Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”
23 They did not know, of course, that Joseph understood what they said, since he spoke with
them through an interpreter. 24 But turning away from them, he wept. When he was able to
speak to them again, he had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. 25 Then
Joseph gave orders to have their containers filled with grain, their money replaced in each one’s
Books of Moses

41

sack, and provisions given them for their journey. After this had been done for them, 26 they
loaded their donkeys with the rations and departed.
27 At the night encampment, when one of them opened his bag to give his donkey some
fodder, he was surprised to see his money in the mouth of his bag. 28 “My money has been
returned!” he cried out to his brothers. “Here it is in my bag!” At that their hearts sank.
Trembling, they asked one another, “What is this that God has done to us?”
29 When they got back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had
happened to them. 30 “The man who is lord of the country,” they said, “spoke to us sternly and
put us in custody as if we were spying on the land. 31 But we said to him: ‘We are honest men;
we have never been spies. 32 There were twelve of us brothers, sons of the same father; but one
is gone, and the youngest one is at present with our father in the land of Canaan.’ 33 Then the
man who is lord of the country said to us: ‘This is how I shall know if you are honest men: leave
one of your brothers with me, while the rest of you go home with rations for your starving
families. 34 When you come back to me with your youngest brother, and I know that you are
honest men and not spies, I will restore your brother to you, and you may move about freely in
the land.’”
35 When they were emptying their sacks, there in each one’s sack was his moneybag! At the
sight of their moneybags, they and their father were dismayed. 36 Their father Jacob said to
them: “Must you make me childless? Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and now you would
take away Benjamin! Why must such things always happen to me?” 37 Then Reuben told his
father: “Put him in my care, and I will bring him back to you. You may kill my own two sons if I
do not return him to you.” 38 But Jacob replied: “My son shall not go down with you. Now that
his full brother is dead, he is the only one left. If some disaster should befall him on the journey
you must make, you would send my white head down to the nether world in grief.”
Gen. 43
The Second Journey to Egypt. 1 Now the famine in the land grew more severe. 2 So when
they had used up all the rations they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back
and procure us a little more food.” 3 But Judah replied: “The man strictly warned us, ‘You shall
not appear in my presence unless your brother is with you.’ 4 If you are willing to let our brother
go with us, we will go down to procure food for you. 5 But if you are not willing, we will not go
down, because the man told us, ‘You shall not appear in my presence unless your brother is with
you.’” 6 Israel demanded, “Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man that you had
another brother?” 7 They answered: “The man kept asking about ourselves and our family: ‘Is
your father still living? Do you have another brother?’ We had to answer his questions. How
could we know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”
8 Then Judah urged his father Israel: “Let the boy go with me, that we may be off and on our
way if you and we and our children are to keep from starving to death. 9 I myself will stand
surety for him. You can hold me responsible for him. If I fail to bring him back, to set him in
your presence, you can hold it against me forever. 10 Had we not dilly-dallied, we could have
been there and back twice by now!”
11 Their father Israel then told them: “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the land’s
best products in your baggage and take them down to the man as gifts: some balm and honey,
gum and resin, and pistachios and almonds. 12 Also take extra money along, for you must return
the amount that was put back in the mouths of your bags; it may have been a mistake. 13 Take
your brother, too, and be off on your way back to the man. 14 May God Almighty dispose the
man to be merciful toward you, so that he may let your other brother go, as well as Benjamin. As
for me, if I am to suffer bereavement, I shall suffer it.”
15 So the men got the gifts, took double the amount of money with them, and, accompanied
by Benjamin, were off on their way down to Egypt to present themselves to Joseph. 16 When
Books of Moses

42

Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his head steward, “Take these men into the house, and
have an animal slaughtered and prepared, for they are to dine with me at noon.” 17 Doing as
Joseph had ordered, the steward conducted the men to Joseph’s house. 18 But on being led to his
house, they became apprehensive. “It must be,” they thought, “on account of the money put back
in our bags the first time, that we are taken inside; they want to use it as a pretext to attack us and
take our donkeys and seize us as slaves.” 19 So they went up to Joseph’s head steward and talked
to him at the entrance of the house. 20 “If you please, sir,” they said, “we came down here once
before to procure food. 21 But when we arrived at a night’s encampment and opened our bags,
there was each man’s money in the mouth of his bag—our money in the full amount! We have
now brought it back. 22 We have brought other money to procure food with. We do not know
who put the first money in our bags.” 23 “Be at ease,” he replied; “you have no need to fear.
Your God and the God of your father must have put treasures in your bags for you. As for your
money, I received it.” With that, he led Simeon out to them.
24 The steward then brought the men inside Joseph’s house. He gave them water to bathe
their feet, and got fodder for their donkeys. 25 Then they set out their gifts to await Joseph’s
arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to dine there. 26 When Joseph came home, they
presented him with the gifts they had brought inside, while they bowed down before him to the
ground. 27 After inquiring how they were, he asked them, “And how is your aged father, of
whom you spoke? Is he still in good health?” 28 “Your servant our father is thriving and still in
good health,” they said, as they bowed respectfully. 29 When Joseph’s eye fell on his full brother
Benjamin, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you told me?” Then he said to him,
“May God be gracious to you, my boy!” 30 With that, Joseph had to hurry out, for he was so
overcome with affection for his brother that he was on the verge of tears. He went into a private
room and wept there.
31 After washing his face, he reappeared and, now in control of himself, gave the order,
“Serve the meal.” 32 It was served separately to him, to the brothers, and to the Egyptians who
partook of his board. (Egyptians may not eat with Hebrews; that is abhorrent to them.) 33 When
they were seated by his directions according to their age, from the oldest to the youngest, they
looked at one another in amazement; 34 and as portions were brought to them from Joseph’s
table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as large as anyone else’s. So they drank freely and
made merry with him.
Gen. 44
Final Test. 1 Then Joseph gave his head steward these instructions: “Fill the men’s bags
with as much food as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his bag. 2 In the
mouth of the youngest one’s bag put also my silver goblet, together with the money for his
rations.” The steward carried out Joseph’s instructions. 3 At daybreak the men and their donkeys
were sent off. 4 They had not gone far out of the city when Joseph said to his head steward: “Go
at once after the men! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why did you repay good with
evil? Why did you steal the silver goblet from me? 5 It is the very one from which my master
drinks and which he uses for divination. What you have done is wrong.’”
6 When the steward overtook them and repeated these words to them, 7 they remonstrated
with him: “How can my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 8
We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of
our bags. Why, then, would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 9 If any of your
servants is found to have the goblet, he shall die, and as for the rest of us, we shall become my
lord’s slaves.” 10 But he replied, “Even though it ought to be as you propose, only the one who
is found to have it shall become my slave, and the rest of you shall be exonerated.” 11 Then each
of them eagerly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it; 12 and when a search was made,
starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest, the goblet turned up in Benjamin’s bag. 13
Books of Moses

43

At this, they tore their clothes. Then, when each man had reloaded his donkey, they returned to
the city.
14 As Judah and his brothers reentered Joseph’s house, he was still there; so they flung
themselves on the ground before him. 15 “How could you do such a thing?” Joseph asked them.
“You should have known that such a man as I could discover by divination what happened.” 16
Judah replied: “What can we say to my lord? How can we plead or how try to prove our
innocence? God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. Here we are, then, the slaves of my lord—
the rest of us no less than the one in whose possession the goblet was found.” 17 “Far be it from
me to act thus!” said Joseph. “Only the one in whose possession the goblet was found shall
become my slave; the rest of you may go back safe and sound to your father.”
18 Judah then stepped up to him and said: “I beg you, my lord, let your servant speak
earnestly to my lord, and do not become angry with your servant, for you are the equal of
Pharaoh. 19 My lord asked your servants, ‘Have you a father, or another brother?’ 20 So we said
to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and a young brother, the child of his old age. This one’s full
brother is dead, and since he is the only one by that mother who is left, his father dotes on him.’
21 Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that my eyes may look on him.’ 22 We
replied to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; his father would die if he were to leave
him.’ 23 But you told your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes back with you, you
shall not come into my presence again.’ 24 When we returned to your servant our father, we
reported to him the words of my lord.
25 “Later, our father told us to come back and buy some food for the family. 26 So we
reminded him, ‘We cannot go down there; only if our youngest brother is with us can we go, for
we may not see the man if our youngest brother is not with us.’ 27 Then your servant our father
said to us, ‘As you know, my wife bore me two sons. 28 One of them, however, disappeared, and
I had to conclude that he must have been torn to pieces by wild beasts; I have not seen him since.
29 If you now take this one away from me too, and some disaster befalls him, you will send my
white head down to the nether world in grief.’
30 “If then the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, whose very life
is bound up with his, he will die as soon as he sees that the boy is missing; 31 and your servants
will thus send the white head of our father down to the nether world in grief. 32 Besides, I, your
servant, got the boy from his father by going surety for him, saying, ‘If I fail to bring him back to
you, father, you can hold it against me forever.’ 33 Let me, your servant, therefore, remain in
place of the boy as the slave of my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers. 34 How could
I go back to my father if the boy were not with me? I could not bear to see the anguish that
would overcome my father.”
Gen. 45
The Truth Revealed. 1 Joseph could no longer control himself in the presence of all his
attendants, so he cried out, “Have everyone withdraw from me!” Thus no one else was about
when he made himself known to his brothers. 2 But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians
heard him, and so the news reached Pharaoh’s palace. 3 “I am Joseph,” he said to his brothers.
“Is my father still in good health?” But his brothers could give him no answer, so dumbfounded
were they at him.
4 “Come closer to me,” he told his brothers. When they had done so, he said: “I am your
brother Joseph, whom you once sold into Egypt. 5 But now do not be distressed, and do not
reproach yourselves for having sold me here. It was really for the sake of saving lives that God
sent me here ahead of you. 6 For two years now the famine has been in the land, and for five
more years tillage will yield no harvest. 7 God, therefore, sent me on ahead of you to ensure for
you a remnant on earth and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance. 8 So it was not
really you but God who had me come here; and he has made of me a father to Pharaoh, lord of
Books of Moses

44

all his household, and ruler over the whole land of Egypt.
9 “Hurry back, then, to my father and tell him: ‘Thus says your son Joseph: God has made
me lord of all Egypt; come to me without delay. 10 You will settle in the region of Goshen,
where you will be near me—you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds,
and everything that you own. 11 Since five years of famine still lie ahead, I will provide for you
there, so that you and your family and all that are yours may not suffer want.’ 12 Surely, you can
see for yourselves, and Benjamin can see for himself, that it is I, Joseph, who am speaking to
you. 13 Tell my father all about my high position in Egypt and what you have seen. But hurry
and bring my father down here.” 14 Thereupon he flung himself on the neck of his brother
Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept in his arms. 15 Joseph then kissed all his brothers,
crying over each of them; and only then were his brothers able to talk with him.
16 When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and
his courtiers were pleased. 17 So Pharaoh told Joseph: “Say to your brothers: ‘This is what you
shall do: Load up your animals and go without delay to the land of Canaan. 18 There get your
father and your families, and then come back here to me; I will assign you the best land in Egypt,
where you will live off the fat of the land.’ 19 Instruct them further: ‘Do this. Take wagons from
the land of Egypt for your children and your wives and to transport your father on your way back
here. 20 Do not be concerned about your belongings, for the best in the whole land of Egypt shall
be yours.’”
21 The sons of Israel acted accordingly. Joseph gave them the wagons, as Pharaoh had
ordered, and he supplied them with provisions for the journey. 22 He also gave to each of them
fresh clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of garments.
23 Moreover, what he sent to his father was ten jackasses loaded with the finest products of
Egypt and ten jennies loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. 24 As he
sent his brothers on their way, he told them, “Let there be no recriminations on the way.”
25 So they left Egypt and made their way to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 26
When they told him, “Joseph is still alive—in fact, it is he who is ruler of all the land of Egypt,”
he was dumbfounded; he could not believe them. 27 But when they recounted to him all that
Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent for his transport, the
spirit of their father Jacob revived. 28 “It is enough,” said Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I
must go and see him before I die.”
Gen. 46
Migration to Egypt. 1 Israel set out with all that was his. When he arrived at Beer-sheba,
he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2 There God, speaking to Israel in a vision by
night, called, “Jacob! Jacob!” “Here I am,” he answered. 3 Then he said: “I am God, the God of
your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation. 4 Not
only will I go down to Egypt with you; I will also bring you back here, after Joseph has closed
your eyes.”
5 So Jacob departed from Beer-sheba, and the sons of Israel put their father and their wives
and children on the wagons that Pharaoh had sent for his transport. 6 They took with them their
livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his
descendants migrated to Egypt. 7 His sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his
granddaughters—all his descendants—he took with him to Egypt.
8 These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his descendants, who migrated to Egypt.
Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, 9 and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
10 The sons of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, son of a Canaanite
woman. 11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan,
Shelah, Perez, and Zerah—but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan; and the sons of
Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 13 The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron. 14
Books of Moses

45

The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 15 These were the sons whom Leah bore to Jacob
in Paddan-aram, along with his daughter Dinah—thirty-three persons in all, male and female.
16 The sons of Gad: Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arod, and Areli. 17 The sons of
Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, with their sister Serah; and the sons of Beriah: Heber
and Malchiel. 18 These were the descendants of Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter
Leah; these she bore to Jacob—sixteen persons in all.
19 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 20 In the land of Egypt Joseph
became the father of Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of
Heliopolis, bore to him. 21 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ahiram,
Shupham, Hupham, and Ard. 22 These were the sons whom Rachel bore to Jacob—fourteen
persons in all.
23 The sons of Dan: Hushim. 24 The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 25
These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel; these she bore to
Jacob—seven persons in all.
26 Jacob’s people who migrated to Egypt—his direct descendants, not counting the wives of
Jacob’s sons—numbered sixty-six persons in all. 27 Together with Joseph’s sons who were born
to him in Egypt—two persons—all the people comprising Jacob’s family who had come to
Egypt amounted to seventy persons in all.
28 Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph, so that he might meet him in Goshen. On his
arrival in the region of Goshen, 29 Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and rode to meet his
father Israel in Goshen. As soon as he saw him, he flung himself on his neck and wept a long
time in his arms. 30 And Israel said to Joseph, “At last I can die, now that I have seen for myself
that Joseph is still alive.”
31 Joseph then said to his brothers and his father’s household: “I will go and inform
Pharaoh, telling him: ‘My brothers and my father’s household, whose home is in the land of
Canaan, have come to me. 32 The men are shepherds, having long been keepers of livestock; and
they have brought with them their flocks and herds, as well as everything else they own.’ 33 So
when Pharaoh summons you and asks what your occupation is, 34 you must answer, ‘We your
servants, like our ancestors, have been keepers of livestock from the beginning until now,’ in
order that you may stay in the region of Goshen, since all shepherds are abhorrent to the
Egyptians.”
Gen. 47
Settlement in Goshen. 1 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers have
come from the land of Canaan, with their flocks and herds and everything else they own; and
they are now in the region of Goshen.” 2 He then presented to Pharaoh five of his brothers whom
he had selected from their full number. 3 When Pharaoh asked them what their occupation was,
they answered, “We, your servants, like our ancestors, are shepherds. 4 We have come,” they
continued, “in order to stay in this country, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks in the
land of Canaan, so severe has the famine been there. Please, therefore, let your servants settle in
the region of Goshen.” 5 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “They may settle in the region of Goshen; and
if you know any of them to be qualified, you may put them in charge of my own livestock.”
Thus, when Jacob and his sons came to Joseph in Egypt, and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, heard
about it, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you, 6 the land
of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and brothers in the pick of the land.” 7 Then
Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh. After Jacob had paid his respects
to Pharaoh, 8 Pharaoh asked him, “How many years have you lived?” 9 Jacob replied: “The
years I have lived as a wayfarer amount to a hundred and thirty. Few and hard have been these
years of my life, and they do not compare with the years that my ancestors lived as wayfarers.”
10 Then Jacob bade Pharaoh farewell and withdrew from his presence.
Books of Moses

46

11 As Pharaoh had ordered, Joseph settled his father and brothers and gave them holdings in
Egypt on the pick of the land, in the region of Rameses. 12 And Joseph sustained his father and
brothers and his father’s whole household, down to the youngest, with food.
Joseph’s Land Policy. 13 Since there was no food in any country because of the extreme
severity of the famine, and the lands of Egypt and Canaan were languishing from hunger, 14
Joseph gathered in, as payment for the rations that were being dispensed, all the money that was
to be found in Egypt and Canaan, and he put it in Pharaoh’s palace. 15 When all the money in
Egypt and Canaan was spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, pleading, “Give us food or we
shall perish under your eyes; for our money is gone.” 16 “Since your money is gone,” replied
Joseph, “give me your livestock, and I will sell you bread in return for your livestock.” 17 So
they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he sold them food in return for their horses, their
flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and their donkeys. Thus he got them through that year with
bread in exchange for all their livestock. 18 When that year ended, they came to him in the
following one and said: “We cannot hide from my lord that, with our money spent and our
livestock made over to my lord, there is nothing left to put at my lord’s disposal except our
bodies and our farm land. 19 Why should we and our land perish before your very eyes? Take us
and our land in exchange for food, and we will become Pharaoh’s slaves and our land his
property; only give us seed, that we may survive and not perish, and that our land may not turn
into a waste.”
20 Thus Joseph acquired all the farm land of Egypt for Pharaoh, since with the famine too
much for them to bear, every Egyptian sold his field; so the land passed over to Pharaoh, 21 and
the people were reduced to slavery, from one end of Egypt’s territory to the other. 22 Only the
priests’ lands Joseph did not take over. Since the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and
lived off the allowance Pharaoh had granted them, they did not have to sell their land.
23 Joseph told the people: “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh, here is
your seed for sowing the land. 24 But when the harvest is in, you must give a fifth of it to
Pharaoh, while you keep four-fifths as seed for your fields and as food for yourselves and your
families (and as food for your children).” 25 “You have saved our lives!” they answered. “We
are grateful to my lord that we can be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 26 Thus Joseph made it a law for the
land in Egypt, which is still in force, that a fifth of its produce should go to Pharaoh. Only the
land of the priests did not pass over to Pharaoh.
Jacob Blesses Ephraim & Manasseh. 27 Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the
region of Goshen. There they acquired property, were fertile, and increased greatly. 28 Jacob
lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years; the span of his life came to a hundred and fortyseven years. 29 When the time approached for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to
him: “If you really wish to please me, put your hand under my thigh as a sign of your constant
loyalty to me; do not let me be buried in Egypt. 30 When I lie down with my ancestors, have me
taken out of Egypt and buried in their burial place.” 31 “I will do as you say,” he replied. But his
father demanded, “Swear it to me!” So Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed at the head of
the bed.
Gen. 48
1 Some time afterward, Joseph was informed, “Your father is failing.” So he took along with
him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2 When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come
to you,” he rallied his strength and sat up in bed.
3 Jacob then said to Joseph: “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan,
and blessing me, 4 he said, ‘I will make you fertile and numerous and raise you into an assembly
of tribes, and I will give this land to your descendants after you as a permanent possession.’ 5
Your two sons, therefore, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I joined you here,
shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as much as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 6
Books of Moses

47

Progeny born to you after them shall remain yours; but their heritage shall be recorded in the
names of their two brothers. 7 I do this because, when I was returning from Paddan, your mother
Rachel died, to my sorrow, during the journey in Canaan, while we were still a short distance
from Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
8 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?” 9 “They are my sons,” Joseph
answered his father, “whom God has given me here.” “Bring them to me,” said his father, “that I
may bless them.” 10 (Now Israel’s eyes were dim from age, and he could not see well.) When
Joseph brought his sons close to him, he kissed and embraced them. 11 Then Israel said to
Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your
descendants as well!”
12 Joseph removed them from his father’s knees and bowed down before him with his face
to the ground. 13 Then Joseph took the two, Ephraim with his right hand, to Israel’s left, and
Manasseh with his left hand, to Israel’s right, and led them to him. 14 But Israel, crossing his
hands, put out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, although he was the younger,
and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, although he was the first-born. 15 Then he blessed
them with these words: “May the God in whose ways my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
The God who has been my shepherd from my birth to this day, 16 The Angel who has delivered
me from all harm, bless these boys That in them my name be recalled, and the names of my
fathers, Abraham and Isaac, And they may become teeming multitudes upon the earth!”
17 When Joseph saw that his father had laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head, this seemed
wrong to him; so he took hold of his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to
Manasseh’s, 18 saying, “That is not right, father; the other one is the first-born; lay your right
hand on his head!” 19 But his father resisted. “I know it, son,” he said, “I know. That one too
shall become a tribe, and he too shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall surpass
him, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.” 20 So when he blessed them that
day and said, “By you shall the people of Israel pronounce blessings; may they say, ‘God make
you like Ephraim and Manasseh,’” he placed Ephraim before Manasseh.
21 Then Israel said to Joseph: “I am about to die. But God will be with you and will restore
you to the land of your fathers. 22 As for me, I give to you, as to the one above his brothers,
Shechem, which I captured from the Amorites with my sword and bow.”
Gen. 49
Jacob’s Testament. 1 Jacob called his sons and said: “Gather around, that I may tell you
what is to happen to you in days to come. 2 “Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob, listen to Israel,
your father.
3 “You, Reuben, my first-born, my strength and the first fruit of my manhood, excelling in
rank and excelling in power! 4 Unruly as water, you shall no longer excel, for you climbed into
your father’s bed and defiled my couch to my sorrow.
5 “Simeon and Levi, brothers indeed, weapons of violence are their knives. 6 Let not my
soul enter their council, or my spirit be joined with their company; For in their fury they slew
men, in their willfulness they maimed oxen. 7 Cursed be their fury so fierce, and their rage so
cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob, disperse them throughout Israel.
8 “You, Judah, shall your brothers praise —your hand on the neck of your enemies; the sons
of your father shall bow down to you. 9 Judah, like a lion’s whelp, you have grown up on prey,
my son. He crouches like a lion recumbent, the king of beasts—who would dare rouse him? 10
The scepter shall never depart from Judah, or the mace from between his legs, While tribute is
brought to him, and he receives the people’s homage. 11 He tethers his donkey to the vine, his
purebred ass to the choicest stem. In wine he washes his garments his robe in the blood of
grapes. 12 His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.
13 “Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore (This means a shore for ships), and his flank shall

48

be based on Sidon.
14 “Issachar is a rawboned ass, crouching between the saddlebags.15 When he saw how
good a settled life was, and how pleasant the country, He bent his shoulder to the burden and
became a toiling serf.
16 “Dan shall achieve justice for his kindred like any other tribe of Israel. 17 Let Dan be a
serpent by the roadside, a horned viper by the path, That bites the horse’s heel, so that the rider
tumbles backward. 18 ”(I long for your deliverance, O LORD!)
19 “Gad shall be raided by raiders, but he shall raid at their heels.
20 “Asher’s produce is rich, and he shall furnish dainties for kings.
21 “Naphtali is a hind let loose which brings forth lovely fawns.
22 “Joseph is a wild colt, a wild colt by a spring, a wild ass on a hillside. 23 Harrying and
attacking, the archers opposed him; 24 But each one’s bow remained stiff, as their arms were
unsteady, By the power of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
25 The God of your father, who helps you, God Almighty, who blesses you, With the blessings
of the heavens above, the blessings of the abyss that crouches below, The blessings of breasts
and womb, 26 the blessings of fresh grain and blossoms, The blessings of the everlasting
mountains, the delights of the eternal hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of
the prince among his brothers.
27 “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; mornings he devours the prey, and evenings he distributes
the spoils.”
Farewell and Death. 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their
father said about them, as he bade them farewell and gave to each of them an appropriate
message. 29 Then he gave them this charge: “Since I am about to be taken to my kindred, bury
me with my fathers in the cave that lies in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 the cave in the field
of Machpelah, facing on Mamre, in the land of Canaan, the field that Abraham bought from
Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground. 31 There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried, and so
are Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there, too, I buried Leah— 32 the field and the cave in it that
had been purchased from the Hittites.”
33 When Jacob had finished giving these instructions to his sons, he drew his feet into the
bed, breathed his last, and was taken to his kindred.
Gen. 50
Jacob’s Funeral. 1 Joseph threw himself on his father’s face and wept over him as he
kissed him. 2 Then he ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father. When they
embalmed Israel, 3 they spent forty days at it, for that is the full period of embalming; and the
Egyptians mourned him for seventy days. 4 When that period of mourning was over, Joseph
spoke to Pharaoh’s courtiers. “Please do me this favor,” he said, “and convey to Pharaoh this
request of mine. 5 Since my father, at the point of death, made me promise on oath to bury him
in the tomb that he had prepared for himself in the land of Canaan, may I go up there to bury my
father and then come back?” 6 Pharaoh replied, “Go and bury your father, as he made you
promise on oath.”
7 So Joseph left to bury his father; and with him went all of Pharaoh’s officials who were
senior members of his court and all the other dignitaries of Egypt, 8 as well as Joseph’s whole
household, his brothers, and his father’s household; only their children and their flocks and herds
were left in the region of Goshen. 9 Chariots, too, and charioteers went up with him; it was a
very large retinue. 10 When they arrived at Goren-ha-atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held
there a very great and solemn memorial service; and Joseph observed seven days of mourning
for his father. 11 When the Canaanites who inhabited the land saw the mourning at Goren-haatad, they said, “This is a solemn funeral the Egyptians are having.” That is why the place was
named Abel-mizraim. It is beyond the Jordan.

49

12 Thus Jacob’s sons did for him as he had instructed them. 13 They carried him to the land
of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, facing on Mamre, the field that
Abraham had bought for a burial ground from Ephron the Hittite.
14 After Joseph had buried his father he returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all
who had gone up with him for the burial of his father.
Plea for Forgiveness. 15 Now that their father was dead, Joseph’s brothers became fearful
and thought, “Suppose Joseph has been nursing a grudge against us and now plans to pay us back
in full for all the wrong we did him!” 16 So they approached Joseph and said: “Before your
father died, he gave us these instructions: 17 ‘You shall say to Joseph, Jacob begs you to forgive
the criminal wrongdoing of your brothers, who treated you so cruelly.’ Please, therefore, forgive
the crime that we, the servants of your father’s God, committed.” When they spoke these words
to him, Joseph broke into tears. 18 Then his brothers proceeded to fling themselves down before
him and said, “Let us be your slaves!” 19 But Joseph replied to them: “Have no fear. Can I take
the place of God? 20 Even though you meant harm to me, God meant it for good, to achieve his
present end, the survival of many people. 21 Therefore have no fear. I will provide for you and
for your children.” By thus speaking kindly to them, he reassured them.
22 Joseph remained in Egypt, together with his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten
years. 23 He saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation, and the children of Manasseh’s son
Machir were also born on Joseph’s knees.
Death of Joseph. 24 Joseph said to his brothers: “I am about to die. God will surely take
care of you and lead you out of this land to the land that he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob.” 25 Then, putting the sons of Israel under oath, he continued, “When God thus takes
care of you, you must bring my bones up with you from this place.” 26 Joseph died at the age of
a hundred and ten. He was embalmed and laid to rest in a coffin in Egypt.

EXODUS
I. THE ISRAELITES IN EGYPT
Ex. 1
Jacob’s Descendants in Egypt. 1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who,
accompanied by their households, migrated with Jacob into Egypt: 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and
Judah; 3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 5 The total
number of the direct descendants of Jacob was seventy. Joseph was already in Egypt.
6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and that whole generation died. 7 But the Israelites were
fruitful and prolific. They became so numerous and strong that the land was filled with them.
The Oppression. 8 Then a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
9 He said to his subjects, “Look how numerous and powerful the Israelite people are growing,
more so than we ourselves! 10 Come, let us deal shrewdly with them to stop their increase;
otherwise, in time of war they too may join our enemies to fight against us, and so leave our
country.”
11 Accordingly, taskmasters were set over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor.
Thus they had to build for Pharaoh the supply cities of Pithom and Raamses. 12 Yet the more
they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians, then, dreaded the
Israelites 13 and reduced them to cruel slavery, 14 making life bitter for them with hard work in
mortar and brick and all kinds of field work—the whole cruel fate of slaves.
Command to the Midwives. 15 The king of Egypt told the Hebrew midwives, one of
whom was called Shiphrah and the other Puah, 16 “When you act as midwives for the Hebrew
women and see them giving birth, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she may live.” 17 The
midwives, however, feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt had ordered them, but let
the boys live. 18 So the king summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you acted
thus, allowing the boys to live?” 19 The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are
not like the Egyptian women. They are robust and give birth before the midwife arrives.” 20
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives. The people, too, increased and grew strong. 21 And
because the midwives feared God, he built up families for them. 22 Pharaoh then commanded all
his subjects, “Throw into the river every boy that is born to the Hebrews, but you may let all the
girls live.”
Ex. 2
Birth and Adoption of Moses. 1 Now a certain man of the house of Levi married a Levite
woman, 2 who conceived and bore a son. Seeing that he was a goodly child, she hid him for
three months. 3 When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket, daubed it with
bitumen and pitch, and putting the child in it, placed it among the reeds on the river bank. 4 His
sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
5 Pharaoh’s daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her maids walked along the
river bank. Noticing the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaid to fetch it. 6 On opening
it, she looked, and lo, there was a baby boy, crying! She was moved with pity for him and said,
“It is one of the Hebrews’ children.” 7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and
call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” 8 “Yes, do so,” she answered. So the
maiden went and called the child’s own mother. 9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this
child and nurse it for me, and I will repay you.” The woman therefore took the child and nursed
it. 10 When the child grew, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who adopted him as her son
and called him Moses; for she said, “I drew him out of the water.”
Moses’ Flight to Midian. 11 On one occasion, after Moses had grown up, when he visited
his kinsmen and witnessed their forced labor, he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his
own kinsmen. 12 Looking about and seeing no one, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the
Books of Moses

51

sand. 13 The next day he went out again, and now two Hebrews were fighting! So he asked the
culprit, “Why are you striking your fellow Hebrew?” 14 But he replied, “Who has appointed you
ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses
became afraid and thought, “The affair must certainly be known.”
15 Pharaoh, too, heard of the affair and sought to put him to death. But Moses fled from him
and stayed in the land of Midian. As he was seated there by a well, 16 seven daughters of a priest
of Midian came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. 17 But some
shepherds came and drove them away. Then Moses got up and defended them and watered their
flock. 18 When they returned to their father Reuel, he said to them, “How is it you have returned
so soon today?” 19 They answered, “An Egyptian saved us from the interference of the
shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock!” 20 “Where is the man?” he asked
his daughters. “Why did you leave him there? Invite him to have something to eat.” 21 Moses
agreed to live with him, and the man gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage. 22 She bore
him a son, whom he named Gershom; for he said, “I am a stranger in a foreign land.”
The Burning Bush. 23 A long time passed, during which the king of Egypt died. Still the
Israelites groaned and cried out because of their slavery. As their cry for release went up to God,
24 he heard their groaning and was mindful of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 25
He saw the Israelites and knew….
Ex. 3
1 Meanwhile Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian.
Leading the flock across the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 2 There an angel of
the LORD appeared to him in fire flaming out of a bush. As he looked on, he was surprised to
see that the bush, though on fire, was not consumed. 3 So Moses decided, “I must go over to
look at this remarkable sight, and see why the bush is not burned.”
The Call of Moses. 4 When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it more closely,
God called out to him from the bush, “Moses! Moses!” He answered, “Here I am.” 5 God said,
“Come no nearer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy
ground. 6 I am the God of your father,” he continued, “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. 7 But the LORD said, “I
have witnessed the affliction of my people in Egypt and have heard their cry of complaint against
their slave drivers, so I know well what they are suffering. 8 Therefore I have come down to
rescue them from the hands of the Egyptians and lead them out of that land into a good and
spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the country of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 9 So indeed the cry of the Israelites has reached me,
and I have truly noted that the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10 Come, now! I will send you to
Pharaoh to lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”
11 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out
of Egypt?” 12 He answered, “I will be with you; and this shall be your proof that it is I who have
sent you: when you bring my people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this very mountain.”
13 “But,” said Moses to God, “when I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your
fathers has sent me to you,’ if they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what am I to tell them?” 14 God
replied, “I am who am.” Then he added, “This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM sent me
to you.”
15 God spoke further to Moses, “Thus shall you say to the Israelites: The LORD, the God of
your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.
“This is my name forever; this is my title for all generations.
16 “Go and assemble the elders of the Israelites, and tell them: The LORD, the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I am concerned
about you and about the way you are being treated in Egypt; 17 so I have decided to lead you up
Books of Moses

52

out of the misery of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites
and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.
18 “Thus they will heed your message. Then you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king
of Egypt and say to him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent us word. Permit us, then,
to go a three days’ journey in the desert, that we may offer sacrifice to the LORD, our God.
19 “Yet I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless he is forced. 20 I will
stretch out my hand, therefore, and smite Egypt by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there.
After that he will send you away. 21 I will even make the Egyptians so well-disposed toward this
people that, when you leave, you will not go empty-handed. 22 Every woman shall ask her
neighbor and her house guest for silver and gold articles and for clothing to put on your sons and
daughters. Thus you will despoil the Egyptians.”
Ex. 4
Confirmation of Moses’ Mission. 1 “But,” objected Moses, “suppose they will not believe
me, nor listen to my plea? For they may say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you.’” 2 The LORD
therefore asked him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he answered. 3 The LORD then
said, “Throw it on the ground.” When he threw it on the ground it was changed into a serpent,
and Moses shied away from it. 4 “Now, put out your hand,” the LORD said to him, “and take
hold of its tail.” So he put out his hand and laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand. 5
“This will take place so that they may believe,” he continued, “that the LORD, the God of their
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, did appear to you.”
6 Again the LORD said to him, “Put your hand in your bosom.” He put it in his bosom, and
when he withdrew it, to his surprise his hand was leprous, like snow. 7 The LORD then said,
“Now, put your hand back in your bosom.” Moses put his hand back in his bosom, and when he
withdrew it, to his surprise it was again like the rest of his body. 8 “If they will not believe you,
nor heed the message of the first sign, they should believe the message of the second. 9 And if
they will not believe even these two signs, nor heed your plea, take some water from the river
and pour it on the dry land. The water you take from the river will become blood on the dry
land.”
Aaron’s Office as Assistant. 10 Moses, however, said to the LORD, “If you please, LORD,
I have never been eloquent, neither in the past, nor recently, nor now that you have spoken to
your servant; but I am slow of speech and tongue.” 11 The LORD said to him, “Who gives one
man speech and makes another deaf and dumb? Or who gives sight to one and makes another
blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 12 Go, then! It is I who will assist you in speaking and will teach
you what you are to say.” 13 Yet he insisted, “If you please, Lord, send someone else!” 14 Then
the LORD became angry with Moses and said, “Have you not your brother, Aaron the Levite? I
know that he is an eloquent speaker. Besides, he is now on his way to meet you. 15 When he
sees you, his heart will be glad. You are to speak to him, then, and put the words in his mouth. I
will assist both you and him in speaking and will teach the two of you what you are to do. 16 He
shall speak to the people for you: he shall be your spokesman, and you shall be as God to him. 17
Take this staff in your hand; with it you are to perform the signs.”
Moses’ Return to Egypt. 18 After this Moses returned to his father-in-law Jethro and said
to him, “Let me go back, please, to my kinsmen in Egypt, to see whether they are still living.”
Jethro replied, “Go in peace.” 19 In Midian the LORD said to Moses, “Go back to Egypt, for all
the men who sought your life are dead.” 20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, and started
back to the land of Egypt, with them riding the ass. The staff of God he carried with him. 21 The
LORD said to him, “On your return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the
wonders I have put in your power. I will make him obstinate, however, so that he will not let the
people go. 22 So you shall say to Pharaoh: Thus says the LORD: Israel is my son, my first-born.
23 Hence I tell you: Let my son go, that he may serve me. If you refuse to let him go, I warn you,
Books of Moses

53

I will kill your son, your first-born.”
24 On the journey, at a place where they spent the night, the Lord came upon Moses and
would have killed him. 25 But Zipporah took a piece of flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and,
touching his person, she said, “You are a spouse of blood to me.” 26 Then God let Moses go. At
that time she said, “A spouse of blood,” in regard to the circumcision.
27 The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the desert to meet Moses.” So he went, and when
they met at the mountain of God, Aaron kissed him. 28 Moses informed him of all the LORD
had said in sending him, and of the various signs he had enjoined upon him. 29 Then Moses and
Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites. 30 Aaron told them everything the
LORD had said to Moses, and he performed the signs before the people. 31 The people believed,
and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their affliction,
they bowed down in worship.
Ex. 5
Pharaoh’s Obduracy. 1 After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says
the LORD, the God of Israel: Let my people go, that they may celebrate a feast to me in the
desert.” 2 Pharaoh answered, “Who is the LORD, that I should heed his plea to let Israel go? I do
not know the LORD; even if I did, I would not let Israel go.” 3 They replied, “The God of the
Hebrews has sent us word. Let us go a three days’ journey in the desert, that we may offer
sacrifice to the LORD, our God; otherwise he will punish us with pestilence or the sword.”
4 The king of Egypt answered them, “What do you mean, Moses and Aaron, by taking the
people away from their work? Off to your labor! 5 Look how numerous the people of the land
are already,” continued Pharaoh, “and yet you would give them rest from their labor!”
6 That very day Pharaoh gave the taskmasters and foremen of the people this order: 7 “You
shall no longer supply the people with straw for their brickmaking as you have previously done.
Let them go and gather straw themselves! 8 Yet you shall levy upon them the same quota of
bricks as they have previously made. Do not reduce it. They are lazy; that is why they are crying,
‘Let us go to offer sacrifice to our God.’ 9 Increase the work for the men, so that they keep their
mind on it and pay no attention to lying words.”
10 So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and told them, “Thus says
Pharaoh: I will not provide you with straw. 11 Go and gather the straw yourselves, wherever you
can find it. Yet there must not be the slightest reduction in your work.” 12 The people, then,
scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw, 13 while the taskmasters kept
driving them on, saying, “Finish your work, the same daily amount as when your straw was
supplied.”
Complaint of the Foremen. 14 The foremen of the Israelites, whom the taskmasters of
Pharaoh had placed over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why have you not completed your
prescribed amount of bricks yesterday and today, as before?”
15 Then the Israelite foremen came and made this appeal to Pharaoh: “Why do you treat
your servants in this manner? 16 No straw is supplied to your servants, and still we are told to
make bricks. Look how your servants are beaten! It is you who are at fault.” 17 Pharaoh
answered, “It is just because you are lazy that you keep saying, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to
the LORD.’ 18 Off to work, then! Straw shall not be provided for you, but you must still deliver
your quota of bricks.”
19 The Israelite foremen knew they were in a sorry plight, having been told not to reduce the
daily amount of bricks. 20 When, therefore, they left Pharaoh and came upon Moses and Aaron,
who were waiting to meet them, 21 they said to them, “The LORD look upon you and judge!
You have brought us into bad odor with Pharaoh and his servants and have put a sword in their
hands to slay us.”

Renewal of God’s Promise. 22 Moses again had recourse to the LORD and said, “Lord,
why do you treat this people so badly? And why did you send me on such a mission? 23 Ever
since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has maltreated this people of yours, and you
have done nothing to rescue them.”
Ex. 6
1 Then the LORD answered Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. Forced
by my mighty hand, he will send them away; compelled by my outstretched arm, he will drive
them from his land.”
2 God also said to Moses, “I am the LORD. 3 As God the Almighty I appeared to Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, but my name, LORD, I did not make known to them. 4 I also established my
covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they were living as
aliens. 5 And now that I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are
treating as slaves, I am mindful of my covenant. 6 Therefore, say to the Israelites: I am the
LORD. I will free you from the forced labor of the Egyptians and will deliver you from their
slavery. I will rescue you by my outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. 7 I will take
you as my own people, and you shall have me as your God. You will know that I, the LORD, am
your God when I free you from the labor of the Egyptians 8 and bring you into the land which I
swore to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I will give it to you as your own possession—I, the
LORD!” 9 But when Moses told this to the Israelites, they would not listen to him because of
their dejection and hard slavery.
10 Then the LORD said to Moses, 11 “Go and tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to let the
Israelites leave his land.” 12 But Moses protested to the LORD, “If the Israelites would not listen
to me, how can it be that Pharaoh will listen to me, poor speaker that I am!” 13 Still, the LORD,
to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them his orders
regarding both the Israelites and Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
Genealogy of Moses and Aaron. 14 These are the heads of the ancestral houses. The sons
of Reuben, the first-born of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the clans of
Reuben. 15 The sons of Simeon were Jenuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Shaul, who was the
son of a Canaanite woman; these are the clans of Simeon. 16 The names of the sons of Levi, in
their genealogical order, are Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived one hundred and thirtyseven years.
17 The sons of Gershon, as heads of clans, were Libni and Shimei. 18 The sons of Kohath
were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived one hundred and thirty-three years. 19 The
sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi in their genealogical order.
20 Amram married his aunt Jochebed, who bore him Aaron, Moses and Miriam. Amram
lived one hundred and thirty-seven years. 21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zichri.
22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri. 23 Aaron married Amminadab’s
daughter, Elisheba, the sister of Nahshon; she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 24
The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These are the clans of the Korahites. 25
Aaron’s son, Eleazar, married one of Putiel’s daughters, who bore him Phinehas. These are the
heads of the ancestral clans of the Levites. 26 This is the Aaron and this the Moses to whom the
LORD said, “Lead the Israelites from the land of Egypt, company by company.” 27 These are
the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of Egypt—the same
Moses and Aaron.
Moses and Aaron Before Pharaoh. 28 On the day the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt 29
he said, “I am the LORD. Repeat to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I tell you.” 30 But Moses
protested to the LORD, “Since I am a poor speaker, how can it be that Pharaoh will listen to
me?”
Books of Moses

55

Ex. 7
1 The LORD answered him, “See! I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your
brother shall act as your prophet. 2 You shall tell him all that I command you. In turn, your
brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave his land. 3 Yet I will make Pharaoh so
obstinate that, despite the many signs and wonders that I will work in the land of Egypt, 4 he will
not listen to you. Therefore I will lay my hand on Egypt and by great acts of judgment I will
bring the hosts of my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt, 5 so that the Egyptians may
learn that I am the LORD, as I stretch out my hand against Egypt and lead the Israelites out of
their midst.”
6 Moses and Aaron did as the LORD had commanded them. 7 Moses was eighty years old
and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
The Staff Turned into a Snake. 8 The LORD told Moses and Aaron, 9 “If Pharaoh
demands that you work a sign or wonder, you shall say to Aaron: Take your staff and throw it
down before Pharaoh, and it will be changed into a snake.” 10 Then Moses and Aaron went to
Pharaoh and did as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and
his servants, and it was changed into a snake. 11 Pharaoh, in turn, summoned wise men and
sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise by their magic arts. 12 Each one
threw down his staff, and it was changed into a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs.
13 Pharaoh, however, was obstinate and would not listen to them, just as the LORD had foretold.
First Plague: Water Turned into Blood. 14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh is
obdurate in refusing to let the people go. 15 Tomorrow morning, when he sets out for the water,
go and present yourself by the river bank, holding in your hand the staff that turned into a
serpent. 16 Say to him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you with the message:
Let my people go to worship me in the desert. But as yet you have not listened. 17 The LORD
now says: This is how you shall know that I am the LORD. I will strike the water of the river
with the staff I hold, and it shall be changed into blood. 18 The fish in the river shall die, and the
river itself shall become so polluted that the Egyptians will be unable to drink its water.”
19 The LORD then said to Moses, “Say to Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand
over the waters of Egypt—their streams and canals and pools, all their supplies of water—that
they may become blood. Throughout the land of Egypt there shall be blood, even in the wooden
pails and stone jars.”
20 Moses and Aaron did as the LORD had commanded. Aaron raised his staff and struck the
waters of the river in full view of Pharaoh and his servants, and all the water of the river was
changed into blood. 21 The fish in the river died, and the river itself became so polluted that the
Egyptians could not drink its water. There was blood throughout the land of Egypt. 22 But the
Egyptian magicians did the same by their magic arts. So Pharaoh remained obstinate and would
not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had foretold. 23 He turned away and went into
his house, with no concern even for this. 24 All the Egyptians had to dig in the neighborhood of
the river for drinking water, since they could not drink the river water.
Second Plague: The Frogs. 25 Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the river. 26
Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him: Thus says the LORD: Let my
people go to worship me. 27 If you refuse to let them go, I warn you, I will send a plague of
frogs over all your territory. 28 The river will teem with frogs. They will come up into your
palace and into your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your servants, too, and your
subjects, even into your ovens and your kneading bowls. 29 The frogs will swarm all over you
and your subjects and your servants.”
Ex. 8
1 The LORD then told Moses, “Say to Aaron: Stretch out your hand and your staff over the
streams and canals and pools, to make frogs overrun the land of Egypt.” 2 Aaron stretched out
Books of Moses

56

his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 3 But
the magicians did the same by their magic arts. They, too, made frogs overrun the land of Egypt.
4 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray the LORD to remove the frogs
from me and my subjects, and I will let the people go to offer sacrifice to the LORD.” 5 Moses
answered Pharaoh, “Do me the favor of appointing the time when I am to pray for you and your
servants and your subjects, that the frogs may be taken away from you and your houses and be
left only in the river.” 6 “Tomorrow,” said Pharaoh. Then Moses replied, “It shall be as you have
said, so that you may learn that there is none like the LORD, our God. 7 The frogs shall leave
you and your houses, your servants and your subjects; only in the river shall they be left.”
8 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh’s presence, Moses implored the LORD to fulfill the
promise he had made to Pharaoh about the frogs; 9 and the LORD did as Moses had asked. The
frogs in the houses and courtyards and fields died off. 10 Heaps and heaps of them were gathered
up, and there was a stench in the land. 11 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he
became obdurate and would not listen to them, just as the LORD had foretold.
Third Plague: The Gnats. 12 Thereupon the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to stretch
out his staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may be turned into gnats throughout the land
of Egypt.” 13 They did so. Aaron stretched out his hand, and with his staff he struck the dust of
the earth, and gnats came upon man and beast. The dust of the earth was turned into gnats
throughout the land of Egypt. 14 Though the magicians tried to bring forth gnats by their magic
arts, they could not do so. As the gnats infested man and beast, 15 the magicians said to Pharaoh,
“This is the finger of God.” Yet Pharaoh remained obstinate and would not listen to them, just as
the LORD had foretold.
Fourth Plague: The Flies. 16 Again the LORD told Moses, “Early tomorrow morning
present yourself to Pharaoh when he goes forth to the water, and say to him: Thus says the
LORD: Let my people go to worship me. 17 If you will not let my people go, I warn you, I will
loose swarms of flies upon you and your servants and your subjects and your houses. The houses
of the Egyptians and the very ground on which they stand shall be filled with swarms of flies. 18
But on that day I will make an exception of the land of Goshen: there shall be no flies where my
people dwell, that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 19 I will make
this distinction between my people and your people. This sign shall take place tomorrow.” 20
This the LORD did. Thick swarms of flies entered the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his
servants; throughout Egypt the land was infested with flies.
21 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said to them, “Go and offer sacrifice to
your God in this land.” 22 But Moses replied, “It is not right to do so, for the sacrifices we offer
to the LORD, our God, are an abomination to the Egyptians. If before their very eyes we offer
sacrifices which are an abomination to them, will not the Egyptians stone us? 23 We must go a
three days’ journey in the desert to offer sacrifice to the LORD, our God, as he commands us.”
24 “Well, then,” said Pharaoh, “I will let you go to offer sacrifice to the LORD, your God, in the
desert, provided that you do not go too far away and that you pray for me.” 25 Moses answered,
“As soon as I leave your presence I will pray to the LORD that the flies may depart tomorrow
from Pharaoh and his servants and his subjects. Pharaoh, however, must not play false again by
refusing to let the people go to offer sacrifice to the LORD.” 26 When Moses left Pharaoh’s
presence, he prayed to the LORD; 27 and the LORD did as Moses had asked. He removed the
flies from Pharaoh and his servants and subjects. Not one remained. 28 But once more Pharaoh
became obdurate and would not let the people go.
Ex. 9
Fifth Plague: The Pestilence. 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell
him: Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to worship me. 2 If you
refuse to let them go and persist in holding them, 3 I warn you, the LORD will afflict all your
Books of Moses

57

livestock in the field—your horses, asses, camels, herds and flocks—with a very severe
pestilence. 4 But the LORD will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so
that none belonging to the Israelites will die.” 5 And setting a definite time, the LORD added,
“Tomorrow the LORD shall do this in the land.” 6 And on the next day the LORD did so. All the
livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one beast belonging to the Israelites. 7 But though
Pharaoh’s messengers informed him that not even one beast belonging to the Israelites had died,
he still remained obdurate and would not let the people go.
Sixth Plague: The Boils. 8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take a double
handful of soot from a furnace, and in the presence of Pharaoh let Moses scatter it toward the
sky. 9 It will then turn into fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and cause festering boils on
man and beast throughout the land.”
10 So they took soot from a furnace and stood in the presence of Pharaoh. Moses scattered it
toward the sky, and it caused festering boils on man and beast. 11 The magicians could not stand
in Moses’ presence, for there were boils on the magicians no less than on the rest of the
Egyptians. 12 But the LORD made Pharaoh obstinate, and he would not listen to them, just as
the LORD had foretold to Moses.
Seventh Plague: The Hail. 13 Then the LORD told Moses, “Early tomorrow morning
present yourself to Pharaoh and say to him: Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let
my people go to worship me, 14 or this time I will hurl all my blows upon you and your servants
and your subjects, that you may know that there is none like me anywhere on earth. 15 For by
now I would have stretched out my hand and struck you and your subjects with such pestilence
as would wipe you from the earth. 16 But this is why I have spared you: to show you my power
and to make my name resound throughout the earth! 17 Will you still block the way for my
people by refusing to let them go? 18 I warn you, then, tomorrow at this hour I will rain down
such fierce hail as there has never been in Egypt from the day the nation was founded up to the
present. 19 Therefore, order all your livestock and whatever else you have in the open fields to
be brought to a place of safety. Whatever man or beast remains in the fields and is not brought to
shelter shall die when the hail comes upon them.” 20 Some of Pharaoh’s servants feared the
warning of the LORD and hurried their servants and livestock off to shelter. 21 Others, however,
did not take the warning of the LORD to heart and left their servants and livestock in the fields.
22 The LORD then said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall
upon the entire land of Egypt, on man and beast and every growing thing in the land of Egypt.”
23 When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent forth hail and peals of
thunder. Lightning flashed toward the earth, and the LORD rained down hail upon the land of
Egypt; 24 and lightning constantly flashed through the hail, such fierce hail as had never been
seen in the land since Egypt became a nation. 25 It struck down every man and beast that was in
the open throughout the land of Egypt; it beat down every growing thing and splintered every
tree in the fields. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites dwelt, was there no hail.
27 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned again! The
LORD is just; it is I and my subjects who are at fault. 28 Pray to the LORD, for we have had
enough of God’s thunder and hail. Then I will let you go; you need stay no longer.” 29 Moses
replied, “As soon as I leave the city I will extend my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease,
and there will be no more hail. Thus you shall learn that the earth is the LORD’S. 30 But you and
your servants, I know, do not yet fear the LORD God.”
31 Now the flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley was in ear and the flax in
bud. 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they grow later.
33 When Moses had left Pharaoh’s presence and had gone out of the city, he extended his
hands to the LORD. Then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down
upon the earth. 34 But Pharaoh, seeing that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased, sinned
again: he with his servants became obdurate, 35 and in his obstinacy he would not let the
Books of Moses

58

Israelites go, as the LORD had foretold through Moses.
Ex. 10
Eighth Plague: The Locusts. 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have
made him and his servants obdurate in order that I may perform these signs of mine among them
2 and that you may recount to your son and grandson how ruthlessly I dealt with the Egyptians
and what signs I wrought among them, so that you may know that I am the LORD.”
3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the
Hebrews: How long will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go to worship me. 4 If you
refuse to let my people go, I warn you, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. 5 They
shall cover the ground, so that the ground itself will not be visible. They shall eat up the remnant
you saved unhurt from the hail, as well as all the foliage that has since sprouted in your fields. 6
They shall fill your houses and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians; such a sight
your fathers or grandfathers have not seen from the day they first settled on this soil up to the
present day.” With that he turned and left Pharaoh.
7 But Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long must he be a menace to us? Let the men go
to worship the LORD, their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is being destroyed?” 8 So
Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, who said to them, “You may go and worship
the LORD, your God. But how many of you will go?” 9 “Young and old must go with us,”
Moses answered, “our sons and daughters as well as our flocks and herds must accompany us.
That is what a feast of the LORD means to us.” 10 “The LORD help you,” Pharaoh replied, “if I
ever let your little ones go with you! Clearly, you have some evil in mind. 11 No, no! Just you
men can go and worship the LORD. After all, that is what you want.” With that they were driven
from Pharaoh’s presence.
12 The LORD then said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, that
locusts may swarm over it and eat up all the vegetation and whatever the hail has left.” 13 So
Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD sent an east wind blowing
over the land all that day and all that night. At dawn the east wind brought the locusts. 14 They
swarmed over the whole land of Egypt and settled down on every part of it. Never before had
there been such a fierce swarm of locusts, nor will there ever be. 15 They covered the surface of
the whole land, till it was black with them. They ate up all the vegetation in the land and the fruit
of whatever trees the hail had spared. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant throughout the
land of Egypt.
16 Hastily Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the
LORD, your God, and against you. 17 But now, do forgive me my sin once more, and pray the
LORD, your God, to take at least this deadly pest from me.” 18 When Moses left the presence of
Pharaoh, he prayed to the LORD, 19 and the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west
wind, which took up the locusts and hurled them into the Red Sea. But though not a single locust
remained within the confines of Egypt, 20 the LORD made Pharaoh obstinate, and he would not
let the Israelites go.
Ninth Plague: The Darkness. 21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand
toward the sky, that over the land of Egypt there may be such intense darkness that one can feel
it.” 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was dense darkness throughout
the land of Egypt for three days. 23 Men could not see one another, nor could they move from
where they were, for three days. But all the Israelites had light where they dwelt.
24 Pharaoh then summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go and worship the LORD. Your
little ones, too, may go with you. But your flocks and herds must remain.” 25 Moses replied,
“You must also grant us sacrifices and holocausts to offer up to the LORD, our God. 26 Hence,
our livestock also must go with us. Not an animal must be left behind. Some of them we must
sacrifice to the LORD, our God, but we ourselves shall not know which ones we must sacrifice
Books of Moses

59

to him until we arrive at the place itself.” 27 But the LORD made Pharaoh obstinate, and he
would not let them go. 28 “Leave my presence,” Pharaoh said to him, “and see to it that you do
not appear before me again! The day you appear before me you shall die!” 29 Moses replied,
“Well said! I will never appear before you again.”
Ex. 11
Tenth Plague: The Death of the First-born. 1 Then the LORD told Moses, “One more
plague will I bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. After that he will let you depart. In fact, he
will not merely let you go; he will drive you away. 2 Instruct your people that every man is to
ask his neighbor, and every woman her neighbor, for silver and gold articles and for clothing.” 3
The LORD indeed made the Egyptians well-disposed toward the people; Moses himself was
very highly regarded by Pharaoh’s servants and the people in the land of Egypt.
4 Moses then said, “Thus says the LORD: At midnight I will go forth through Egypt. 5
Every first-born in this land shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh on the throne to the firstborn of the slave-girl at the handmill, as well as all the first-born of the animals. 6 Then there
shall be loud wailing throughout the land of Egypt, such as has never been, nor will ever be
again. 7 But among the Israelites and their animals not even a dog shall growl, so that you may
know how the LORD distinguishes between the Egyptians and the Israelites. 8 All these servants
of yours shall then come down to me, and prostrate before me, they shall beg me, ‘Leave us, you
and all your followers!’ Only then will I depart.” With that he left Pharaoh’s presence in hot
anger.
9 The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh refuses to listen to you that my wonders may be
multiplied in the land of Egypt.” 10 Thus, although Moses and Aaron performed these various
wonders in Pharaoh’s presence, the LORD made Pharaoh obstinate, and he would not let the
Israelites leave his land.
Ex. 12
The Passover Ritual Prescribed. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of
Egypt, 2 “This month shall stand at the head of your calendar; you shall reckon it the first month
of the year. 3 Tell the whole community of Israel: On the tenth of this month every one of your
families must procure for itself a lamb, one apiece for each household. 4 If a family is too small
for a whole lamb, it shall join the nearest household in procuring one and shall share in the lamb
in proportion to the number of persons who partake of it. 5 The lamb must be a year-old male
and without blemish. You may take it from either the sheep or the goats. 6 You shall keep it until
the fourteenth day of this month, and then, with the whole assembly of Israel present, it shall be
slaughtered during the evening twilight. 7 They shall take some of its blood and apply it to the
two doorposts and the lintel of every house in which they partake of the lamb. 8 That same night
they shall eat its roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 9 It shall not be eaten raw
or boiled, but roasted whole, with its head and shanks and inner organs. 10 None of it must be
kept beyond the next morning; whatever is left over in the morning shall be burned up.
11 “This is how you are to eat it: with your loins girt, sandals on your feet and your staff in
hand, you shall eat like those who are in flight. It is the Passover of the LORD. 12 For on this
same night I will go through Egypt, striking down every first—born of the land, both man and
beast, and executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt - I, the LORD! 13 But the blood will
mark the houses where you are. Seeing the blood, I will pass over you; thus, when I strike the
land of Egypt, no destructive blow will come upon you.
14 “This day shall be a memorial feast for you, which all your generations shall celebrate
with pilgrimage to the LORD, as a perpetual institution. 15 For seven days you must eat
unleavened bread. From the very first day you shall have your houses clear of all leaven.
Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day to the seventh shall be cut off from Israel. 16 On
Books of Moses

60

the first day you shall hold a sacred assembly, and likewise on the seventh. On these days you
shall not do any sort of work, except to prepare the food that everyone needs.
17 “Keep, then, this custom of the unleavened bread. Since it was on this very day that I
brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt, you must celebrate this day throughout your
generations as a perpetual institution. 18 From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first
month until the evening of the twenty-first day of this month you shall eat unleavened bread. 19
For seven days no leaven may be found in your houses. Anyone, be he a resident alien or a
native, who eats leavened food shall be cut off from the community of Israel. 20 Nothing
leavened may you eat; wherever you dwell you may eat only unleavened bread.”
Promulgation of the Passover. 21 Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them,
“Go and procure lambs for your families, and slaughter them as Passover victims. 22 Then take a
bunch of hyssop, and dipping it in the blood that is in the basin, sprinkle the lintel and the two
doorposts with this blood. But none of you shall go outdoors until morning. 23 For the LORD
will go by, striking down the Egyptians. Seeing the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, the
LORD will pass over that door and not let the destroyer come into your houses to strike you
down.
24 “You shall observe this as a perpetual ordinance for yourselves and your descendants. 25
Thus, you must also observe this rite when you have entered the land which the LORD will give
you as he promised. 26 When your children ask you, ‘What does this rite of yours mean?’ 27 you
shall reply, ‘This is the Passover sacrifice of the LORD, who passed over the houses of the
Israelites in Egypt; when he struck down the Egyptians, he spared our houses.’”
Then the people bowed down in worship, 28 and the Israelites went and did as the LORD
had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Death of the First Born. 29 At midnight the LORD slew every first-born in the land of
Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh on the throne to the first-born of the prisoner in the
dungeon, as well as all the first-born of the animals. 30 Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his
servants and all the Egyptians; and there was loud wailing throughout Egypt, for there was not a
house without its dead.
Premission to Depart. 31 During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said,
“Leave my people at once, you and the Israelites with you! Go and worship the LORD as you
said. 32 Take your flocks, too, and your herds, as you demanded, and be gone; and you will be
doing me a favor.”
33 The Egyptians likewise urged the people on, to hasten their departure from the land; they
thought that otherwise they would all die. 34 The people, therefore, took their dough before it
was leavened, in their kneading bowls wrapped in their cloaks on their shoulders. 35 The
Israelites did as Moses had commanded: they asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold
and for clothing. 36 The LORD indeed had made the Egyptians so well-disposed toward the
people that they let them have whatever they asked for. Thus did they despoil the Egyptians.
II. THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT AND THE JOURNEY TO SINAI
Departure from Egypt. 37 The Israelites set out from Rameses for Succoth, about six
hundred thousand men on foot, not counting the children. 38 A crowd of mixed ancestry also
went up with them, besides their livestock, very numerous flocks and herds. 39 Since the dough
they had brought out of Egypt was not leavened, they baked it into unleavened loaves. They had
been rushed out of Egypt and had no opportunity even to prepare food for the journey.
40 The time the Israelites had stayed in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 41 At the
end of four hundred and thirty years, all the hosts of the LORD left the land of Egypt on this very
date. 42 This was a night of vigil for the LORD, as he led them out of the land of Egypt; so on
this same night all the Israelites must keep a vigil for the LORD throughout their generations.

61

Passover Regulations. 43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations
for the Passover. No foreigner may partake of it. 44 However, any slave who has been bought for
money may partake of it, provided you have first circumcised him. 45 But no transient alien or
hired servant may partake of it. 46 It must be eaten in one and the same house; you may not take
any of its flesh outside the house. You shall not break any of its bones. 47 The whole community
of Israel must keep this feast. 48 If any aliens living among you wish to celebrate the Passover of
the LORD, all the males among them must first be circumcised, and then they may join in its
observance just like the natives. But no man who is uncircumcised may partake of it. 49 The law
shall be the same for the resident alien as for the native.”
50 All the Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 51 On that
same day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt company by company.
Ex. 13
Consecration of the First Born. 1 The LORD spoke to Moses and said, 2 “Consecrate to
me every first-born that opens the womb among the Israelites, both of man and beast, for it
belongs to me.” 3 Moses said to the people, “Remember this day on which you came out of
Egypt, that place of slavery. It was with a strong hand that the LORD brought you away. Nothing
made with leaven must be eaten. 4 This day of your departure is in the month of Abib. 5
Therefore, it is in this month that you must celebrate this rite, after the LORD, your God, has
brought you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites, which he
swore to your fathers he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey. 6 For seven days
you shall eat unleavened bread, and the seventh day shall also be a festival to the LORD. 7 Only
unleavened bread may be eaten during the seven days; no leaven and nothing leavened may be
found in all your territory. 8 On this day you shall explain to your son, ‘This is because of what
the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9 It shall be as a sign on your hand and as a
reminder on your forehead; thus the law of the LORD will ever be on your lips, because with a
strong hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. 10 Therefore, you shall keep this prescribed
rite at its appointed time from year to year.
11 “When the LORD, your God, has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, which he
swore to you and your fathers he would give you, 12 you shall dedicate to the LORD every son
that opens the womb; and all the male firstlings of your animals shall belong to the LORD. 13
Every first-born of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep. If you do not redeem it, you shall break
its neck. Every first-born son you must redeem. 14 If your son should ask you later on, ‘What
does this mean?’ you shall tell him, ‘With a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, that
place of slavery. 15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, every first-born of man and of beast. That is why I sacrifice to the
LORD everything of the male sex that opens the womb, and why I redeem every first-born of my
sons.’ 16 Let this, then, be as a sign on your hand and as a pendant on your forehead: with a
strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”
Toward the Red Sea. 17 Now, when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by
way of the Philistines’ land, though this was the nearest; for he thought, should the people see
that they would have to fight, they might change their minds and return to Egypt. 18 Instead, he
rerouted them toward the Red Sea by way of the desert road. In battle array the Israelites
marched out of Egypt. 19 Moses also took Joseph’s bones along, for Joseph had made the
Israelites swear solemnly that, when God should come to them, they would carry his bones away
with them.
20 Setting out from Succoth, they camped at Etham near the edge of the desert.
21 The LORD preceded them, in the daytime by means of a column of cloud to show them
the way, and at night by means of a column of fire to give them light. Thus they could travel both
day and night. 22 Neither the column of cloud by day nor the column of fire by night ever left its

62

place in front of the people.
Ex. 14
1 Then the LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites to turn about and camp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, just opposite, by
the sea. 3 Pharaoh will then say, ‘The Israelites are wandering about aimlessly in the land. The
desert has closed in on them.’ 4 Thus will I make Pharaoh so obstinate that he will pursue them.
Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I
am the LORD.”
This the Israelites did. 5 When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled,
Pharaoh and his servants changed their minds about them. “What have we done!” they
exclaimed. “Why, we have released Israel from our service!” 6 So Pharaoh made his chariots
ready and mustered his soldiers— 7 six hundred first-class chariots and all the other chariots of
Egypt, with warriors on them all. 8 So obstinate had the LORD made Pharaoh that he pursued
the Israelites even while they were marching away in triumph. 9 The Egyptians, then, pursued
them; Pharaoh’s whole army, his horses, chariots and charioteers, caught up with them as they
lay encamped by the sea, at Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
Crossing of the Red Sea. 10 Pharaoh was already near when the Israelites looked up and
saw that the Egyptians were on the march in pursuit of them. In great fright they cried out to the
LORD. 11 And they complained to Moses, “Were there no burial places in Egypt that you had to
bring us out here to die in the desert? Why did you do this to us? Why did you bring us out of
Egypt? 12 Did we not tell you this in Egypt, when we said, ‘Leave us alone. Let us serve the
Egyptians’? Far better for us to be the slaves of the Egyptians than to die in the desert.” 13 But
Moses answered the people, “Fear not! Stand your ground, and you will see the victory the
LORD will win for you today. These Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.
14 The LORD himself will fight for you; you have only to keep still.”
15 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to go
forward. 16 And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea in
two, that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land. 17 But I will make the Egyptians so
obstinate that they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his
army, his chariots and charioteers. 18 The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.”
19 The angel of God, who had been leading Israel’s camp, now moved and went around
behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them, 20 so
that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became
dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.
21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong
east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided,
22 the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their
right and to their left.
Destruction of the Egyptians. 23 The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh’s horses
and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea. 24 In the night watch
just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a
glance that threw it into a panic; 25 and he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly
drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting
for them against the Egyptians.
26 Then the LORD told Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow
back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers.” 27 So Moses stretched out
his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were
fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst. 28 As the water
Books of Moses

63

flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh’s whole army which had
followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped. 29 But the Israelites had
marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to
their left. 30 Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians. When
Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore 31 and beheld the great power that the
LORD had shown against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his
servant Moses.
Ex. 15
1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: “I will sing to the LORD, for
he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has cast into the sea. 2 My strength and my
courage is the LORD, and he has been my savior. He is my God, I praise him; the God of my
father, I extol him.
3 The LORD is a warrior, LORD is his name! 4 Pharaoh’s chariots and army he hurled into
the sea; the elite of his officers were submerged in the Red Sea. 5 The flood waters covered
them, they sank into the depths like a stone.
6 Your right hand, O LORD, magnificent in power, your right hand, O LORD, has shattered
the enemy. 7 In your great majesty you overthrew your adversaries; you loosed your wrath to
consume them like stubble. 8 At a breath of your anger the waters piled up, the flowing waters
stood like a mound, the flood waters congealed in the midst of the sea.
9 The enemy boasted, “I will pursue and overtake them; I will divide the spoils and have my
fill of them; I will draw my sword; my hand shall despoil them!” 10 When your wind blew, the
sea covered them; like lead they sank in the mighty waters.
11 Who is like to you among the gods, O LORD? Who is like to you, magnificent in
holiness? O terrible in renown, worker of wonders, 12 when you stretched out your right hand,
the earth swallowed them! 13 In your mercy you led the people you redeemed; in your strength
you guided them to your holy dwelling.
14 The nations heard and quaked; anguish gripped the dwellers in Philistia. 15 Then were
the princes of Edom dismayed; trembling seized the chieftains of Moab; All the dwellers in
Canaan melted away; 16 terror and dread fell upon them. By the might of your arm they were
frozen like stone, while your people, O LORD, passed over, while the people you had made your
own passed over.
17 And you brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your inheritance—
the place where you made your seat, O LORD, the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands
established. 18 The LORD shall reign forever and ever.”
19 They sang thus because Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and charioteers had gone into the
sea, and the LORD made the waters of the sea flow back upon them, though the Israelites had
marched on dry land through the midst of the sea. 20 The prophetess Miriam, Aaron’s sister,
took a tambourine in her hand, while all the women went out after her with tambourines,
dancing; 21 and she led them in the refrain: “Sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant;
horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.”
At Morah and Elim. 22 Then Moses led Israel forward from the Red Sea, and they
marched out to the desert of Shur. After traveling for three days through the desert without
finding water, 23 they arrived at Marah, where they could not drink the water, because it was too
bitter. Hence this place was called Marah. 24 As the people grumbled against Moses, saying,
“What are we to drink?” 25 he appealed to the LORD, who pointed out to him a certain piece of
wood. When he threw this into the water, the water became fresh.
It was here that the LORD, in making rules and regulations for them, put them to the test. 26
“If you really listen to the voice of the LORD, your God,” he told them, “and do what is right in
his eyes: if you heed his commandments and keep all his precepts, I will not afflict you with any
Books of Moses

64

of the diseases with which I afflicted the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer.”
27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm
trees, and they camped there near the water.
Ex. 16
The Desert of Sin. 1 Having set out from Elim, the whole Israelite community came into
the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after
their departure from the land of Egypt. 2 Here in the desert the whole Israelite community
grumbled against Moses and Aaron. 3 The Israelites said to them, “Would that we had died at the
LORD’S hand in the land of Egypt, as we sat by our fleshpots and ate our fill of bread! But you
had to lead us into this desert to make the whole community die of famine!”
The Quail and Manna. 4 Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will now rain down bread
from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather their daily portion; thus will I
test them, to see whether they follow my instructions or not. 5 On the sixth day, however, when
they prepare what they bring in, let it be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” 6 So
Moses and Aaron told all the Israelites, “At evening you will know that it was the LORD who
brought you out of the land of Egypt; 7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD,
as he heeds your grumbling against him. But what are we that you should grumble against us? 8
When the LORD gives you flesh to eat in the evening,” continued Moses, “and in the morning
your fill of bread, as he heeds the grumbling you utter against him, what then are we? Your
grumbling is not against us, but against the LORD.”
9 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole Israelite community: Present yourselves before
the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.” 10 When Aaron announced this to the whole
Israelite community, they turned toward the desert, and lo, the glory of the LORD appeared in
the cloud! 11 The LORD spoke to Moses and said, 12 “I have heard the grumbling of the
Israelites. Tell them: In the evening twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall
have your fill of bread, so that you may know that I, the LORD, am your God.”
13 In the evening quail came up and covered the camp. In the morning a dew lay all about
the camp, 14 and when the dew evaporated, there on the surface of the desert were fine flakes
like hoarfrost on the ground. 15 On seeing it, the Israelites asked one another, “What is this?” for
they did not know what it was. But Moses told them, “This is the bread which the LORD has
given you to eat.
Regulations Regarding the Manna. 16 “Now, this is what the LORD has commanded. So
gather it that everyone has enough to eat, an omer for each person, as many of you as there are,
each man providing for those of his own tent.” 17 The Israelites did so. Some gathered a large
and some a small amount. 18 But when they measured it out by the omer, he who had gathered a
large amount did not have too much, and he who had gathered a small amount did not have too
little. They so gathered that everyone had enough to eat. 19 Moses also told them, “Let no one
keep any of it over until tomorrow morning.” 20 But they would not listen to him. When some
kept a part of it over until the following morning, it became wormy and rotten. Therefore Moses
was displeased with them.
21 Morning after morning they gathered it, till each had enough to eat; but when the sun
grew hot, the manna melted away. 22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two
omers for each person. When all the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses,
23 he told them, “That is what the LORD prescribed. Tomorrow is a day of complete rest, the
sabbath, sacred to the LORD. You may either bake or boil the manna, as you please; but
whatever is left put away and keep for the morrow.” 24 When they put it away for the morrow,
as Moses commanded, it did not become rotten or wormy. 25 Moses then said, “Eat it today, for
today is the sabbath of the LORD. On this day you will not find any of it on the ground. 26 On
the other six days you can gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, none of it will be there.”
Books of Moses

65

27 Still, on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, although they did not find
any. 28 Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments
and laws? 29 Take note! The LORD has given you the sabbath. That is why on the sixth day he
gives you food for two days. On the seventh day everyone is to stay home and no one is to go
out.” 30 After that the people rested on the seventh day.
31 The Israelites called this food manna. It was like coriander seed, but white, and it tasted
like wafers made with honey.
32 Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded. Keep an omerful of manna for
your descendants, that they may see what food I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you
out of the land of Egypt.” 33 Moses then told Aaron, “Take an urn and put an omer of manna in
it. Then place it before the LORD in safekeeping for your descendants.” 34 So Aaron placed it in
front of the commandments for safekeeping, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
35 The Israelites ate this manna for forty years, until they came to settled land; they ate
manna until they reached the borders of Canaan. 36 (An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
Ex. 17
Water from the Rock. 1 From the desert of Sin the whole Israelite community journeyed
by stages, as the LORD directed, and encamped at Rephidim.
Here there was no water for the people to drink. 2 They quarreled, therefore, with Moses and
said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put
the LORD to a test?” 3 Here, then, in their thirst for water, the people grumbled against Moses,
saying, “Why did you ever make us leave Egypt? Was it just to have us die here of thirst with
our children and our livestock?” 4 So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this
people? A little more and they will stone me!” 5 The LORD answered Moses, “Go over there in
front of the people, along with some of the elders of Israel, holding in your hand, as you go, the
staff with which you struck the river. 6 I will be standing there in front of you on the rock in
Horeb. Strike the rock, and the water will flow from it for the people to drink.” This Moses did,
in the presence of the elders of Israel. 7 The place was called Massah and Meribah, because the
Israelites quarreled there and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD in our midst or not?”
Battle with Amalek. 8 At Rephidim, Amalek came and waged war against Israel. 9 Moses,
therefore, said to Joshua, “Pick out certain men, and tomorrow go out and engage Amalek in
battle. I will be standing on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” 10 So Joshua did as
Moses told him: he engaged Amalek in battle after Moses had climbed to the top of the hill with
Aaron and Hur. 11 As long as Moses kept his hands raised up, Israel had the better of the fight,
but when he let his hands rest, Amalek had the better of the fight. 12 Moses’ hands, however,
grew tired; so they put a rock in place for him to sit on. Meanwhile Aaron and Hur supported his
hands, one on one side and one on the other, so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 13 And
Joshua mowed down Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this down in a document as something to be
remembered, and recite it in the ears of Joshua: I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek
from under the heavens.” 15 Moses also built an altar there, which he called Yahweh-nissi; 16
for he said, “The LORD takes in hand his banner; the LORD will war against Amalek through
the centuries.”
Ex. 18
Meeting with Jethro. 1 Now Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard of all
that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel: how the LORD had brought Israel out of
Egypt. 2 So his father-in-law Jethro took along Zipporah, Moses’ wife, whom Moses had sent
back to him, 3 and her two sons. One of these was called Gershom; for he said, “I am a stranger
in a foreign land.” 4 The other was called Eliezer; for he said, “My father’s God is my helper; he
Books of Moses

66

has rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword.” 5 Together with Moses’ wife and sons, then, his fatherin-law Jethro came to him in the desert where he was encamped near the mountain of God, 6 and
he sent word to Moses, “I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife
and her two sons.”
7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down before him, and kissed him.
Having greeted each other, they went into the tent. 8 Moses then told his father-in-law of all that
the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and of all the hardships
they had had to endure on their journey, and how the LORD had come to their rescue. 9 Jethro
rejoiced over all the goodness that the LORD had shown Israel in rescuing them from the hands
of the Egyptians. 10 “Blessed be the LORD,” he said, “who has rescued his people from the
hands of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. 11 Now I know that the LORD is a deity great beyond any
other; for he took occasion of their being dealt with insolently to deliver the people from the
power of the Egyptians.” 12 Then Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, brought a holocaust and
other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to participate with Moses’
father-in-law in the meal before God.
Appointment of Minor Judges. 13 The next day Moses sat in judgment for the people,
who waited about him from morning until evening. 14 When his father-in-law saw all that he
was doing for the people, he inquired, “What sort of thing is this that you are doing for the
people? Why do you sit alone while all the people have to stand about you from morning till
evening?” 15 Moses answered his father-in-law, “The people come to me to consult God. 16
Whenever they have a disagreement, they come to me to have me settle the matter between them
and make known to them God’s decisions and regulations.”
17 “You are not acting wisely,” his father-in-law replied. 18 “You will surely wear yourself
out, and not only yourself but also these people with you. The task is too heavy for you; you
cannot do it alone. 19 Now, listen to me, and I will give you some advice, that God may be with
you. Act as the people’s representative before God, bringing to him whatever they have to say.
20 Enlighten them in regard to the decisions and regulations, showing them how they are to live
and what they are to do. 21 But you should also look among all the people for able and Godfearing men, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain, and set them as officers over groups of
thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 22 Let these men render decisions for the people
in all ordinary cases. More important cases they should refer to you, but all the lesser cases they
can settle themselves. Thus, your burden will be lightened, since they will bear it with you. 23 If
you do this, when God gives you orders you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people
will go home satisfied.”
24 Moses followed the advice of his father-in-law and did all that he had suggested. 25 He
picked out able men from all Israel and put them in charge of the people as officers over groups
of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. 26 They rendered decisions for the people in all
ordinary cases. The more difficult cases they referred to Moses, but all the lesser cases they
settled themselves. 27 Then Moses bade farewell to his father-in-law, who went off to his own
country.
III. THE COVENANT AT MOUNT SINAI
Ex. 19
Arrival at Sinai. 1 In the third month after their departure from the land of Egypt, on its
first day, the Israelites came to the desert of Sinai. 2 After the journey from Rephidim to the
desert of Sinai, they pitched camp.
While Israel was encamped here in front of the mountain, 3 Moses went up the mountain to
God. Then the LORD called to him and said, “Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob; 4 tell the
Israelites: You have seen for yourselves how I treated the Egyptians and how I bore you up on
eagle wings and brought you here to myself. 5 Therefore, if you hearken to my voice and keep
Books of Moses

67

my covenant, you shall be my special possession, dearer to me than all other people, though all
the earth is mine. 6 You shall be to me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation. That is what you must
tell the Israelites.” 7 So Moses went and summoned the elders of the people. When he set before
them all that the LORD had ordered him to tell them, 8 the people all answered together,
“Everything the LORD has said, we will do.” Then Moses brought back to the LORD the
response of the people.
9 The LORD also told him, “I am coming to you in a dense cloud, so that when the people
hear me speaking with you, they may always have faith in you also.” When Moses, then, had
reported to the LORD the response of the people, 10 the LORD added, “Go to the people and
have them sanctify themselves today and tomorrow. Make them wash their garments 11 and be
ready for the third day; for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai before
the eyes of all the people. 12 Set limits for the people all around the mountain, and tell them:
Take care not to go up the mountain, or even to touch its base. If anyone touches the mountain,
he must be put to death. 13 No hand shall touch him; he must be stoned to death or killed with
arrows. Such a one, man or beast, must not be allowed to live. Only when the ram’s horn
resounds may they go up to the mountain.” 14 Then Moses came down from the mountain to the
people and had them sanctify themselves and wash their garments. 15 He warned them, “Be
ready for the third day. Have no intercourse with any woman.”
The Great Theophany. 16 On the morning of the third day there were peals of thunder and
lightning, and a heavy cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the
people in the camp trembled. 17 But Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they
stationed themselves at the foot of the mountain. 18 Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke, for
the LORD came down upon it in fire. The smoke rose from it as though from a furnace, and the
whole mountain trembled violently. 19 The trumpet blast grew louder and louder, while Moses
was speaking and God answering him with thunder.
20 When the LORD came down to the top of Mount Sinai, he summoned Moses to the top
of the mountain, and Moses went up to him. 21 Then the LORD told Moses, “Go down and warn
the people not to break through toward the LORD in order to see him; otherwise many of them
will be struck down. 22 The priests, too, who approach the LORD must sanctify themselves; else
he will vent his anger upon them.” 23 Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot go up to
Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us to set limits around the mountain to make it sacred.” 24
The LORD repeated, “Go down now! Then come up again along with Aaron. But the priests and
the people must not break through to come up to the LORD; else he will vent his anger upon
them.” 25 So Moses went down to the people and told them this.
Ex. 20
The Ten Commandments. 1 Then God delivered all these commandments:
2 “I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of
slavery. 3 You shall not have other gods besides me. 4 You shall not carve idols for yourselves in
the shape of anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth; 5
you shall not bow down before them or worship them. For I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous
God, inflicting punishment for their fathers’ wickedness on the children of those who hate me,
down to the third and fourth generation; 6 but bestowing mercy down to the thousandth
generation, on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments.
7 “You shall not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain. For the LORD will not
leave unpunished him who takes his name in vain.
8 “Remember to keep holy the sabbath day. 9 Six days you may labor and do all your work,
10 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD, your God. No work may be done then either
by you, or your son or daughter, or your male or female slave, or your beast, or by the alien who
lives with you. 11 In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in
Books of Moses

68

them; but on the seventh day he rested. That is why the LORD has blessed the sabbath day and
made it holy.
12 “Honor your father and your mother, that you may have a long life in the land which the
LORD, your God, is giving you.
13 “You shall not kill.
14 “You shall not commit adultery.
15 “You shall not steal.
16 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
17 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,
nor his male or female slave, nor his ox or ass, nor anything else that belongs to him.”
The Fear of God. 18 When the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the trumpet
blast and the mountain smoking, they all feared and trembled. So they took up a position much
farther away 19 and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but let not God speak to
us, or we shall die.” 20 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid, for God has come to you
only to test you and put his fear upon you, lest you should sin.” 21 Still the people remained at a
distance, while Moses approached the cloud where God was.
22 The LORD told Moses, “Thus shall you speak to the Israelites: You have seen for
yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven. 23 Do not make anything to rank with me;
neither gods of silver nor gods of gold shall you make for yourselves.
24 “An altar of earth you shall make for me, and upon it you shall sacrifice your holocausts
and peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In whatever place I choose for the remembrance
of my name I will come to you and bless you. 25 If you make an altar of stone for me, do not
build it of cut stone, for by putting a tool to it you desecrate it. 26 You shall not go up by steps to
my altar, on which you must not be indecently uncovered.
Ex. 21
Laws Regarding Slaves. 1 “These are the rules you shall lay before them. 2 When you
purchase a Hebrew slave, he is to serve you for six years, but in the seventh year he shall be
given his freedom without cost. 3 If he comes into service alone, he shall leave alone; if he
comes with a wife, his wife shall leave with him. 4 But if his master gives him a wife and she
bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall remain the master’s property and
the man shall leave alone. 5 If, however, the slave declares, ‘I am devoted to my master and my
wife and children; I will not go free,’ 6 his master shall bring him to God and there, at the door
or doorpost, he shall pierce his ear with an awl, thus keeping him as his slave forever.
7 “When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go free as male slaves do. 8 But if
her master, who had destined her for himself, dislikes her, he shall let her be redeemed. He has
no right to sell her to a foreigner, since he has broken faith with her. 9 If he destines her for his
son, he shall treat her like a daughter. 10 If he takes another wife, he shall not withhold her food,
her clothing, or her conjugal rights. 11 If he does not grant her these three things, she shall be
given her freedom absolutely, without cost to her.
Personal Injury. 12 “Whoever strikes a man a mortal blow must be put to death. 13 He,
however, who did not hunt a man down, but caused his death by an act of God, may flee to a
place which I will set apart for this purpose. 14 But when a man kills another after maliciously
scheming to do so, you must take him even from my altar and put him to death. 15 Whoever
strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.
16 “A kidnaper, whether he sells his victim or still has him when caught, shall be put to
death.
17 “Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death.
18 “When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, not mortally,
but enough to put him in bed, 19 the one who struck the blow shall be acquitted, provided the
Books of Moses

69

other can get up and walk around with the help of his staff. Still, he must compensate him for his
enforced idleness and provide for his complete cure.
20 “When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under
his hand, he shall be punished. 21 If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be
punished, since the slave is his own property.
22 “When men have a fight and hurt a pregnant woman, so that she suffers a miscarriage,
but no further injury, the guilty one shall be fined as much as the woman’s husband demands of
him, and he shall pay in the presence of the judges. 23 But if injury ensues, you shall give life for
life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for
wound, stripe for stripe.
26 “When a man strikes his male or female slave in the eye and destroys the use of the eye,
he shall let the slave go free in compensation for the eye. 27 If he knocks out a tooth of his male
or female slave, he shall let the slave go free in compensation for the tooth.
28 “When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned; its flesh may not
be eaten. The owner of the ox, however, shall go unpunished. 29 But if an ox was previously in
the habit of goring people and its owner, though warned, would not keep it in; should it then kill
a man or a woman, not only must the ox be stoned, but its owner also must be put to death. 30 If,
however, a fine is imposed on him, he must pay in ransom for his life whatever amount is
imposed on him. 31 This law applies if it is a boy or a girl that the ox gores. 32 But if it is a male
or a female slave that it gores, he must pay the owner of the slave thirty shekels of silver, and the
ox must be stoned.
Property Damage. 33 “When a man uncovers or digs a cistern and does not cover it over
again, should an ox or an ass fall into it, 34 the owner of the cistern must make good by restoring
the value of the animal to its owner; the dead animal, however, he may keep.
35 “When one man’s ox hurts another’s ox so badly that it dies, they shall sell the live ox
and divide this money as well as the dead animal equally between them. 36 But if it was known
that the ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner would not keep it in, he must
make full restitution, an ox for an ox; but the dead animal he may keep.
37 “When a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters or sells it, he shall restore five oxen
for the one ox, and four sheep for the one sheep.
Ex. 22
1 ”(If a thief is caught in the act of housebreaking and beaten to death, there is no bloodguilt
involved. 2 But if after sunrise he is thus beaten, there is bloodguilt.) He must make full
restitution. If he has nothing, he shall be sold to pay for his theft. 3 If what he stole is found alive
in his possession, be it an ox, an ass or a sheep, he shall restore two animals for each one stolen.
4 “When a man is burning over a field or a vineyard, if he lets the fire spread so that it burns
in another’s field, he must make restitution with the best produce of his own field or vineyard. 5
If the fire spreads further, and catches on to thorn bushes, so that shocked grain or standing grain
or the field itself is burned up, the one who started the fire must make full restitution.
Trusts & Loans. 6 “When a man gives money or an article to another for safekeeping and
it is stolen from the latter’s house, the thief, if caught, must make twofold restitution. 7 If the
thief is not caught, the owner of the house shall be brought to God, to swear that he himself did
not lay hands on his neighbor’s property. 8 In every question of dishonest appropriation, whether
it be about an ox, or an ass, or a sheep, or a garment, or anything else that has disappeared, where
another claims that the thing is his, both parties shall present their case before God; the one
whom God convicts must make twofold restitution to the other.
9 “When a man gives an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any other animal to another for
safekeeping, if it dies, or is maimed or snatched away, without anyone witnessing the fact, 10 the
custodian shall swear by the LORD that he did not lay hands on his neighbor’s property; the
Books of Moses

70

owner must accept the oath, and no restitution is to be made. 11 But if the custodian is really
guilty of theft, he must make restitution to the owner. 12 If it has been killed by a wild beast, let
him bring it as evidence, and he need not make restitution for the mangled animal.
13 “When a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, if it is maimed or dies while the
owner is not present, the man must make restitution. 14 But if the owner is present, he need not
make restitution. If it was hired, this was covered by the price of its hire.
Social Laws. 15 “When a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he
shall pay her marriage price and marry her. 16 If her father refuses to give her to him, he must
still pay him the customary marriage price for virgins.
17 “You shall not let a sorceress live.
18 “Anyone who lies with an animal shall be put to death.
19 “Whoever sacrifices to any god, except to the LORD alone, shall be doomed.
20 “You shall not molest or oppress an alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land
of Egypt. 21 You shall not wrong any widow or orphan. 22 If ever you wrong them and they cry
out to me, I will surely hear their cry. 23 My wrath will flare up, and I will kill you with the
sword; then your own wives will be widows, and your children orphans.
24 “If you lend money to one of your poor neighbors among my people, you shall not act
like an extortioner toward him by demanding interest from him. 25 If you take your neighbor’s
cloak as a pledge, you shall return it to him before sunset; 26 for this cloak of his is the only
covering he has for his body. What else has he to sleep in? If he cries out to me, I will hear him;
for I am compassionate.
27 “You shall not revile God, nor curse a prince of your people.
28 “You shall not delay the offering of your harvest and your press. You shall give me the
first-born of your sons. 29 You must do the same with your oxen and your sheep; for seven days
the firstling may stay with its mother, but on the eighth day you must give it to me.
30 “You shall be men sacred to me. Flesh torn to pieces in the field you shall not eat; throw
it to the dogs.
Ex. 23
1 “You shall not repeat a false report. Do not join the wicked in putting your hand, as an
unjust witness, upon anyone. 2 Neither shall you allege the example of the many as an excuse for
doing wrong, nor shall you, when testifying in a lawsuit, side with the many in perverting justice.
3 You shall not favor a poor man in his lawsuit.
4 “When you come upon your enemy’s ox or ass going astray, see to it that it is returned to
him. 5 When you notice the ass of one who hates you lying prostrate under its burden, by no
means desert him; help him, rather, to raise it up.
6 “You shall not deny one of your needy fellow men his rights in his lawsuit. 7 You shall
keep away from anything dishonest. The innocent and the just you shall not put to death, nor
shall you acquit the guilty. 8 Never take a bribe, for a bribe blinds even the most clear-sighted
and twists the words even of the just. 9 You shall not oppress an alien; you well know how it
feels to be an alien, since you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.
Religious Laws. 10 “For six years you may sow your land and gather in its produce. 11 But
the seventh year you shall let the land lie untilled and unharvested, that the poor among you may
eat of it and the beasts of the field may eat what the poor leave. So also shall you do in regard to
your vineyard and your olive grove.
12 “For six days you may do your work, but on the seventh day you must rest, that your ox
and your ass may also have rest, and that the son of your maidservant and the alien may be
refreshed. 13 Give heed to all that I have told you.
“Never mention the name of any other god; it shall not be heard from your lips.
14 “Three times a year you shall celebrate a pilgrim feast to me. 15 You shall keep the feast
Books of Moses

71

of Unleavened Bread. As I have commanded you, you must eat unleavened bread for seven days
at the prescribed time in the month of Abib, for it was then that you came out of Egypt. No one
shall appear before me empty-handed. 16 You shall also keep the feast of the grain harvest with
the first of the crop that you have sown in the field; and finally, the feast at the fruit harvest at the
end of the year, when you gather in the produce from the fields. 17 Thrice a year shall all your
men appear before the Lord GOD.
18 “You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; nor shall the fat of
my feast be kept overnight till the next day. 19 The choicest first fruits of your soil you shall
bring to the house of the LORD, your God. “You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
Reward for Fidelity. 20 “See, I am sending an angel before you, to guard you on the way
and bring you to the place I have prepared. 21 Be attentive to him and heed his voice. Do not
rebel against him, for he will not forgive your sin. My authority resides in him. 22 If you heed
his voice and carry out all I tell you, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.
23 “My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites,
Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites; and I will wipe them out. 24 Therefore, you shall not bow
down in worship before their gods, nor shall you make anything like them; rather, you must
demolish them and smash their sacred pillars. 25 The LORD, your God, you shall worship; then
I will bless your food and drink, and I will remove all sickness from your midst; 26 no woman in
your land will be barren or miscarry; and I will give you a full span of life.
27 “I will have the fear of me precede you, so that I will throw into panic every nation you
reach. I will make all your enemies turn from you in flight, 28 and ahead of you I will send
hornets to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites out of your way. 29 But not in one year will
I drive them all out before you; else the land will become so desolate that the wild beasts will
multiply against you. 30 Instead, I will drive them out little by little before you, until you have
grown numerous enough to take possession of the land. 31 I will set your boundaries from the
Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River; all who dwell in this land I
will hand over to you to be driven out of your way. 32 You shall not make a covenant with them
or their gods. 33 They must not abide in your land, lest they make you sin against me by
ensnaring you into worshiping their gods.”
Ex. 24
Ratification of the Covenant. 1 Moses himself was told, “Come up to the LORD, you and
Aaron, with Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You shall all worship at some
distance, 2 but Moses alone is to come close to the LORD; the others shall not come too near,
and the people shall not come up at all with Moses.”
3 When Moses came to the people and related all the words and ordinances of the LORD,
they all answered with one voice, “We will do everything that the LORD has told us.” 4 Moses
then wrote down all the words of the LORD and, rising early the next day, he erected at the foot
of the mountain an altar and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel. 5 Then, having sent
certain young men of the Israelites to offer holocausts and sacrifice young bulls as peace
offerings to the LORD, 6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in large bowls; the other half he
splashed on the altar. 7 Taking the book of the covenant, he read it aloud to the people, who
answered, “All that the LORD has said, we will heed and do.” 8 Then he took the blood and
sprinkled it on the people, saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made
with you in accordance with all these words of his.”
9 Moses then went up with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel, 10 and they
beheld the God of Israel. Under his feet there appeared to be sapphire tilework, as clear as the
sky itself. 11 Yet he did not smite these chosen Israelites. After gazing on God, they could still
eat and drink.
Moses on the Mountain. 12 The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain
Books of Moses

72

and, while you are there, I will give you the stone tablets on which I have written the
commandments intended for their instruction.” 13 So Moses set out with Joshua, his aide, and
went up to the mountain of God. 14 The elders, however, had been told by him, “Wait here for
us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are staying with you. If anyone has a complaint, let him
refer the matter to them.” 15 After Moses had gone up, a cloud covered the mountain. 16 The
glory of the LORD settled upon Mount Sinai. The cloud covered it for six days, and on the
seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 17 To the Israelites the glory of the
LORD was seen as a consuming fire on the mountaintop. 18 But Moses passed into the midst of
the cloud as he went up on the mountain; and there he stayed for forty days and forty nights.
IV. THE DWELLING AND ITS FURNISHINGS
Ex. 25
Collection of Materials. 1 This is what the LORD then said to Moses: 2 “Tell the Israelites
to take up a collection for me. From every man you shall accept the contribution that his heart
prompts him to give me. 3 These are the contributions you shall accept from them: gold, silver
and bronze; 4 violet, purple and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair; 5 rams’ skins dyed red, and
tahash skins; acacia wood; 6 oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant
incense; 7 onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the ephod and the breastpiece.
8 “They shall make a sanctuary for me, that I may dwell in their midst. 9 This Dwelling and
all its furnishings you shall make exactly according to the pattern that I will now show you.
Plan of the Ark. 10 “You shall make an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, one
and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 11 Plate it inside and outside with pure
gold, and put a molding of gold around the top of it. 12 Cast four gold rings and fasten them on
the four supports of the ark, two rings on one side and two on the opposite side. 13 Then make
poles of acacia wood and plate them with gold. 14 These poles you are to put through the rings
on the sides of the ark, for carrying it; 15 they must remain in the rings of the ark and never be
withdrawn. 16 In the ark you are to put the commandments which I will give you.
17 “You shall then make a propitiatory of pure gold, two cubits and a half long, and one and
a half cubits wide. 18 Make two cherubim of beaten gold for the two ends of the propitiatory, 19
fastening them so that one cherub springs direct from each end. 20 The cherubim shall have their
wings spread out above, covering the propitiatory with them; they shall be turned toward each
other, but with their faces looking toward the propitiatory. 21 This propitiatory you shall then
place on top of the ark. In the ark itself you are to put the commandments which I will give you.
22 There I will meet you and there, from above the propitiatory, between the two cherubim on
the ark of the commandments, I will tell you all the commands that I wish you to give the
Israelites.
The Table. 23 “You shall also make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide,
and a cubit and a half high. 24 Plate it with pure gold and make a molding of gold around it. 25
Surround it with a frame, a handbreadth high, with a molding of gold around the frame. 26 You
shall also make four rings of gold for it and fasten them at the four corners, one at each leg, 27
on two opposite sides of the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table. 28 These poles for
carrying the table you shall make of acacia wood and plate with gold. 29 Of pure gold you shall
make its plates and cups, as well as its pitchers and bowls for pouring libations. 30 On the table
you shall always keep showbread set before me.
The Lampstand. 31 “You shall make a lampstand of pure beaten gold - its shaft and
branches - with its cups and knobs and petals springing directly from it. 32 Six branches are to
extend from the sides of the lampstand, three branches on one side, and three on the other. 33 On
one branch there are to be three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and
petals; on the opposite branch there are to be three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with
its knob and petals; and so for the six branches that extend from the lampstand. 34 On the shaft
Books of Moses

73

there are to be four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals, 35 including
a knob below each of the three pairs of branches that extend from the lampstand. 36 Their knobs
and branches shall so spring from it that the whole will form but a single piece of pure beaten
gold. 37 You shall then make seven lamps for it and so set up the lamps that they shed their light
on the space in front of the lampstand. 38 These, as well as the trimming shears and trays, must
be of pure gold. 39 Use a talent of pure gold for the lampstand and all its appurtenances. 40 See
that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
Ex. 26
The Tent Cloth. 1 “The Dwelling itself you shall make out of sheets woven of fine linen
twined and of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim embroidered on them. 2 The length
of each shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width four cubits; all the sheets shall be of the same
size. 3 Five of the sheets are to be sewed together, edge to edge; and the same for the other five.
4 Make loops of violet yarn along the edge of the end sheet in one set, and the same along the
edge of the end sheet in the other set. 5 There are to be fifty loops along the edge of the end sheet
in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding sheet in the second set, and so
placed that the loops are directly opposite each other. 6 Then make fifty clasps of gold, with
which to join the two sets of sheets, so that the Dwelling forms one whole.
7 “Also make sheets woven of goat hair, to be used as a tent covering over the Dwelling. 8
Eleven such sheets are to be made; the length of each shall be thirty cubits, and the width four
cubits: all eleven sheets shall be of the same size. 9 Sew five of the sheets, edge to edge, into one
set, and the other six sheets into another set. Use the sixth sheet double at the front of the tent. 10
Make fifty loops along the edge of the end sheet in one set, and fifty loops along the edge of the
end sheet in the second set. 11 Also make fifty bronze clasps and put them into the loops, to join
the tent into one whole. 12 There will be an extra half sheet of tent covering, which shall be
allowed to hang down over the rear of the Dwelling. 13 Likewise, the sheets of the tent will have
an extra cubit’s length to be left hanging down on either side of the Dwelling to protect it. 14
Over the tent itself you shall make a covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and above that, a covering
of tahash skins.
The Wooden Walls. 15 “You shall make boards of acacia wood as walls for the Dwelling.
16 The length of each board is to be ten cubits, and its width one and a half cubits. 17 Each board
shall have two arms that shall serve to fasten the boards in line. In this way all the boards of the
Dwelling are to be made. 18 Set up the boards of the Dwelling as follows: twenty boards on the
south side, 19 with forty silver pedestals under the twenty boards, so that there are two pedestals
under each board, at its two arms; 20 twenty boards on the other side of the Dwelling, the north
side, 21 with their forty silver pedestals, two under each board; 22 six boards for the rear of the
Dwelling, to the west; 23 and two boards for the corners at the rear of the Dwelling. 24 These
two shall be double at the bottom, and likewise double at the top, to the first ring. That is how
both boards in the corners are to be made. 25 Thus, there shall be in the rear eight boards, with
their sixteen silver pedestals, two pedestals under each board. 26 Also make bars of acacia wood:
five for the boards on one side of the Dwelling, 27 five for those on the other side, and five for
those at the rear, toward the west. 28 The center bar, at the middle of the boards, shall reach
across from end to end. 29 Plate the boards with gold, and make gold rings on them as holders
for the bars, which are also to be plated with gold. 30 You shall erect the Dwelling according to
the pattern shown you on the mountain.
The Veils. 31 “You shall have a veil woven of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, and of fine
linen twined, with cherubim embroidered on it. 32 It is to be hung on four gold-plated columns
of acacia wood, which shall have hooks of gold and shall rest on four silver pedestals. 33 Hang
the veil from clasps. The ark of the commandments you shall bring inside, behind this veil which
divides the holy place from the holy of holies. 34 Set the propitiatory on the ark of the
Books of Moses

74

commandments in the holy of holies.
35 “Outside the veil you shall place the table and the lampstand, the latter on the south side
of the Dwelling, opposite the table, which is to be put on the north side. 36 For the entrance of
the tent make a variegated curtain of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined. 37
Make five columns of acacia wood for this curtain; have them plated with gold, with their hooks
of gold; and cast five bronze pedestals for them.
Ex. 27
The Altar of Holocausts. 1 “You shall make an altar of acacia wood, on a square, five
cubits long and five cubits wide; it shall be three cubits high. 2 At the four corners there are to be
horns, so made that they spring directly from the altar. You shall then plate it with bronze. 3
Make pots for removing the ashes, as well as shovels, basins, forks and fire pans, all of which
shall be of bronze. 4 Make a grating of bronze network for it; this to have four bronze rings, one
at each of its four corners. 5 Put it down around the altar, on the ground. This network is to be
half as high as the altar. 6 You shall also make poles of acacia wood for the altar, and plate them
with bronze. 7 These poles are to be put through the rings, so that they are on either side of the
altar when it is carried. 8 Make the altar itself in the form of a hollow box, just as it was shown
you on the mountain.
Court of the Dwelling. 9 “You shall also make a court for the Dwelling. On the south side
the court shall have hangings a hundred cubits long, woven of fine linen twined, 10 with twenty
columns and twenty pedestals of bronze; the hooks and bands on the columns shall be of silver.
11 On the north side there shall be similar hangings, a hundred cubits long, with twenty columns
and twenty pedestals of bronze; the hooks and bands on the columns shall be of silver. 12 On the
west side, across the width of the court, there shall be hangings, fifty cubits long, with ten
columns and ten pedestals. 13 The width of the court on the east side shall be fifty cubits. 14 On
one side there shall be hangings to the extent of fifteen cubits, with three columns and three
pedestals; 15 on the other side there shall be hangings to the extent of fifteen cubits, with three
columns and three pedestals.
16 “At the entrance of the court there shall be a variegated curtain, twenty cubits long,
woven of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined. It shall have four columns and
four pedestals.
17 “All the columns around the court shall have bands and hooks of silver, and pedestals of
bronze. 18 The enclosure of the court is to be one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and five
cubits high. Fine linen twined must be used, and the pedestals must be of bronze. 19 All the
fittings of the Dwelling, whatever be their use, as well as all its tent pegs and all the tent pegs of
the court, must be of bronze.
Oil for the Lamps. 20 “You shall order the Israelites to bring you clear oil of crushed
olives, to be used for the light, so that you may keep lamps burning regularly. 21 From evening
to morning Aaron and his sons shall maintain them before the LORD in the meeting tent, outside
the veil which hangs in front of the commandments. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for the
Israelites throughout their generations.
Ex. 28
The Priestly Vestments. 1 “From among the Israelites have your brother Aaron, together
with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, brought to you, that they may be my priests. 2
For the glorious adornment of your brother Aaron you shall have sacred vestments made. 3
Therefore, to the various expert workmen whom I have endowed with skill, you shall give
instructions to make such vestments for Aaron as will set him apart for his sacred service as my
priest. 4 These are the vestments they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a brocaded
tunic, a miter and a sash. In making these sacred vestments which your brother Aaron and his
Books of Moses

75

sons are to wear in serving as my priests, 5 they shall use gold, violet, purple and scarlet yarn and
fine linen.
The Ephod & Breastpiece. 6 “The ephod they shall make of gold thread and of violet,
purple and scarlet yarn, embroidered on cloth of fine linen twined. 7 It shall have a pair of
shoulder straps joined to its two upper ends. 8 The embroidered belt of the ephod shall extend
out from it and, like it, be made of gold thread, of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, and of fine
linen twined.
9 “Get two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: 10 six of their
names on one stone, and the other six on the other stone, in the order of their birth. 11 As a gemcutter engraves a seal, so shall you have the two stones engraved with the names of the sons of
Israel and then mounted in gold filigree work. 12 Set these two stones on the shoulder straps of
the ephod as memorial stones of the sons of Israel. Thus Aaron shall bear their names on his
shoulders as a reminder before the LORD. 13 Make filigree rosettes of gold, 14 as well as two
chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, and fasten the cordlike chains to the filigree rosettes.
15 “The breastpiece of decision you shall also have made, embroidered like the ephod with
gold thread and violet, purple and scarlet yarn on cloth of fine linen twined. 16 It is to be square
when folded double, a span high and a span wide. 17 On it you shall mount four rows of precious
stones: in the first row, a carnelian, a topaz and an emerald; 18 in the second row, a garnet, a
sapphire and a beryl; 19 in the third row, a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst; 20 in the fourth
row, a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper. These stones are to be mounted in gold filigree work, 21
twelve of them to match the names of the sons of Israel, each stone engraved like a seal with the
name of one of the twelve tribes.
22 “When the chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, have been made for the breastpiece, 23
you shall then make two rings of gold for it and fasten them to the two upper ends of the
breastpiece. 24 The gold cords are then to be fastened to the two rings at the upper ends of the
breastpiece, 25 the other two ends of the cords being fastened in front to the two filigree rosettes
which are attached to the shoulder straps of the ephod. 26 Make two other rings of gold and put
them on the two lower ends of the breastpiece, on its edge that faces the ephod. 27 Then make
two more rings of gold and fasten them to the bottom of the shoulder straps next to where they
join the ephod in front, just above its embroidered belt. 28 Violet ribbons shall bind the rings of
the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod, so that the breastpiece will stay right above the
embroidered belt of the ephod and not swing loose from it.
29 “Whenever Aaron enters the sanctuary, he will thus bear the names of the sons of Israel
on the breastpiece of decision over his heart as a constant reminder before the LORD. 30 In this
breastpiece of decision you shall put the Urim and Thummim, that they may be over Aaron’s
heart whenever he enters the presence of the LORD. Thus he shall always bear the decisions for
the Israelites over his heart in the LORD’S presence.
Other Vestments. 31 “The robe of the ephod you shall make entirely of violet material. 32
It shall have an opening for the head in the center, and around this opening there shall be a
selvage, woven as at the opening of a shirt, to keep it from being torn. 33 All around the hem at
the bottom you shall make pomegranates, woven of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen
twined, with gold bells between them; 34 first a gold bell, then a pomegranate, and thus
alternating all around the hem of the robe. 35 Aaron shall wear it when ministering, that its
tinkling may be heard as he enters and leaves the LORD’S presence in the sanctuary; else he will
die.
36 “You shall also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, as on a seal engraving,
‘Sacred to the LORD.’ 37 This plate is to be tied over the miter with a violet ribbon in such a
way that it rests on the front of the miter, 38 over Aaron’s forehead. Since Aaron bears whatever
guilt the Israelites may incur in consecrating any of their sacred gifts, this plate must always be
over his forehead, so that they may find favor with the LORD.
Books of Moses

76

39 “The tunic of fine linen shall be brocaded. The miter shall be made of fine linen. The
sash shall be of variegated work.
40 “Likewise, for the glorious adornment of Aaron’s sons you shall have tunics and sashes
and turbans made. 41 With these you shall clothe your brother Aaron and his sons. Anoint and
ordain them, consecrating them as my priests. 42 You must also make linen drawers for them, to
cover their naked flesh from their loins to their thighs. 43 Aaron and his sons shall wear them
whenever they go into the meeting tent or approach the altar to minister in the sanctuary, lest
they incur guilt and die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his descendants.
Ex. 29
Consecration of the Priests. 1 “This is the rite you shall perform in consecrating them as
my priests. Procure a young bull and two unblemished rams. 2 With fine wheat flour make
unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, 3 and put them in a
basket. Take the basket of them along with the bullock and the two rams. 4 Aaron and his sons
you shall also bring to the entrance of the meeting tent, and there wash them with water. 5 Take
the vestments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the
breastpiece, fastening the embroidered belt of the ephod around him. 6 Put the miter on his head,
the sacred diadem on the miter. 7 Then take the anointing oil and anoint him with it, pouring it
on his head. 8 Bring forward his sons also and clothe them with the tunics, 9 gird them with the
sashes, and tie the turbans on them. Thus shall the priesthood be theirs by perpetual law, and thus
shall you ordain Aaron and his sons.
Ordination Sacrifices. 10 “Now bring forward the bullock in front of the meeting tent.
There Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. 11 Then slaughter the bullock before
the LORD, at the entrance of the meeting tent. 12 Take some of its blood and with your finger
put it on the horns of the altar. All the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.
13 All the fat that covers its inner organs, as well as the lobe of its liver and its two kidneys,
together with the fat that is on them, you shall take and burn on the altar. 14 But the flesh and
hide and offal of the bullock you must burn up outside the camp, since this is a sin offering.
15 “Then take one of the rams, and after Aaron and his sons have laid their hands on its
head, 16 slaughter it. The blood you shall take and splash on all the sides of the altar. 17 Cut the
ram into pieces; its inner organs and shanks you shall first wash, and then put them with the
pieces and with the head. 18 The entire ram shall then be burned on the altar, since it is a
holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
19 “After this take the other ram, and when Aaron and his sons have laid their hands on its
head, 20 slaughter it. Some of its blood you shall take and put on the tip of Aaron’s right ear and
on the tips of his sons’ right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and the great toes of their
right feet. Splash the rest of the blood on all the sides of the altar. 21 Then take some of the
blood that is on the altar, together with some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle this on Aaron and
his vestments, as well as on his sons and their vestments, that his sons and their vestments may
be sacred.
22 “Now, from this ram you shall take its fat: its fatty tail, the fat that covers its inner
organs, the lobe of its liver, its two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and its right thigh, since
this is the ordination ram; 23 then, out of the basket of unleavened food that you have set before
the LORD, you shall take one of the loaves of bread, one of the cakes made with oil, and one of
the wafers. 24 All these things you shall put into the hands of Aaron and his sons, so that they
may wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 25 After you have received them back
from their hands, you shall burn them on top of the holocaust on the altar as a sweet-smelling
oblation to the LORD. 26 Finally, take the breast of Aaron’s ordination ram and wave it as a
wave offering before the LORD; this is to be your own portion.
27 “Thus shall you set aside the breast of whatever wave offering is waved, as well as the
Books of Moses

77

thigh of whatever raised offering is raised up, whether this be the ordination ram or anything else
belonging to Aaron or to his sons. 28 Such things are due to Aaron and his sons from the
Israelites by a perpetual ordinance as a contribution. From their peace offerings, too, the
Israelites shall make a contribution, their contribution to the LORD.
29 “The sacred vestments of Aaron shall be passed down to his descendants, that in them
they may be anointed and ordained. 30 The descendant who succeeds him as priest and who is to
enter the meeting tent to minister in the sanctuary shall be clothed with them for seven days.
31 “You shall take the flesh of the ordination ram and boil it in a holy place. 32 At the
entrance of the meeting tent Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is
in the basket. 33 They themselves are to eat of these things by which atonement was made at
their ordination and consecration; but no layman may eat of them, since they are sacred. 34 If
some of the flesh of the ordination sacrifice or some of the bread remains over on the next day,
this remnant must be burned up; it is not to be eaten, since it is sacred. 35 Carry out all these
orders in regard to Aaron and his sons just as I have given them to you.
“Seven days you shall spend in ordaining them, 36 sacrificing a bullock each day as a sin
offering, to make atonement. Thus also shall you purge the altar in making atonement for it; you
shall anoint it in order to consecrate it. 37 Seven days you shall spend in making atonement for
the altar and in consecrating it. Then the altar will be most sacred, and whatever touches it will
become sacred.
38 “Now, this is what you shall offer on the altar: two yearling lambs as the sacrifice
established for each day; 39 one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at the evening twilight.
40 With the first lamb there shall be a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin
of oil of crushed olives and, as its libation, a fourth of a hin of wine. 41 The other lamb you shall
offer at the evening twilight, with the same cereal offering and libation as in the morning. You
shall offer this as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 42 Throughout your generations this
established holocaust shall be offered before the LORD at the entrance of the meeting tent,
where I will meet you and speak to you.
43 “There, at the altar, I will meet the Israelites; hence, it will be made sacred by my glory.
44 Thus I will consecrate the meeting tent and the altar, just as I also consecrate Aaron and his
sons to be my priests. 45 I will dwell in the midst of the Israelites and will be their God. 46 They
shall know that I, the LORD, am their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, so that I,
the LORD, their God, might dwell among them.
Ex. 30
Altar of Incense. 1 “For burning incense you shall make an altar of acacia wood, 2 with a
square surface, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high, with horns that spring directly
from it. 3 Its grate on top, its walls on all four sides, and its horns you shall plate with pure gold.
Put a gold molding around it. 4 Underneath the molding you shall put gold rings, two on one side
and two on the opposite side, as holders for the poles used in carrying it. 5 Make the poles, too,
of acacia wood and plate them with gold. 6 This altar you are to place in front of the veil that
hangs before the ark of the commandments where I will meet you.
7 “On it Aaron shall burn fragrant incense. Morning after morning, when he prepares the
lamps, 8 and again in the evening twilight, when he lights the lamps, he shall burn incense.
Throughout your generations this shall be the established incense offering before the LORD. 9
On this altar you shall not offer up any profane incense, or any holocaust or cereal offering; nor
shall you pour out a libation upon it. 10 Once a year Aaron shall perform the atonement rite on
its horns. Throughout your generations this atonement is to be made once a year with the blood
of the atoning sin offering. This altar is most sacred to the LORD.”
Census Tax. 11 The LORD also said to Moses, 12 “When you take a census of the
Israelites who are to be registered, each one, as he is enrolled, shall give the LORD a forfeit for
Books of Moses

78

his life, so that no plague may come upon them for being registered. 13 Everyone who enters the
registered group must pay a half-shekel, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel,
twenty gerahs to the shekel. This payment of a half-shekel is a contribution to the LORD. 14
Everyone of twenty years or more who enters the registered group must give this contribution to
the LORD. 15 The rich need not give more, nor shall the poor give less, than a half-shekel in this
contribution to the LORD to pay the forfeit for their lives. 16 When you receive this forfeit
money from the Israelites, you shall donate it to the service of the meeting tent, that there it may
be the Israelites’ reminder before the LORD, of the forfeit paid for their lives.”
The Laver. 17 The LORD said to Moses, 18 “For ablutions you shall make a bronze laver
with a bronze base. Place it between the meeting tent and the altar, and put water in it. 19 Aaron
and his sons shall use it in washing their hands and feet. 20 When they are about to enter the
meeting tent, they must wash with water, lest they die. Likewise when they approach the altar in
their ministry, to offer an oblation to the LORD, 21 they must wash their hands and feet, lest
they die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him and his descendants throughout their
generations.”
The Anointing Oil. 22 The LORD said to Moses, 23 “Take the finest spices: five hundred
shekels of free-flowing myrrh; half that amount, that is, two hundred and fifty shekels, of
fragrant cinnamon; two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant cane; 24 five hundred shekels of
cassia - all according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel; together with a hin of olive oil; 25
and blend them into sacred anointing oil, perfumed ointment expertly prepared. 26 With this
sacred anointing oil you shall anoint the meeting tent and the ark of the commandments, 27 the
table and all its appurtenances, the lampstand and its appurtenances, the altar of incense 28 and
the altar of holocausts with all its appurtenances, and the laver with its base. 29 When you have
consecrated them, they shall be most sacred; whatever touches them shall be sacred. 30 Aaron
and his sons you shall also anoint and consecrate as my priests. 31 To the Israelites you shall say:
As sacred anointing oil this shall belong to me throughout your generations. 32 It may not be
used in any ordinary anointing of the body, nor may you make any other oil of a like mixture. It
is sacred, and shall be treated as sacred by you. 33 Whoever prepares a perfume like this, or
whoever puts any of this on a layman, shall be cut off from his kinsmen.”
The Incense. 34 The LORD told Moses, “Take these aromatic substances: storax and
onycha and galbanum, these and pure frankincense in equal parts; 35 and blend them into
incense. This fragrant powder, expertly prepared, is to be salted and so kept pure and sacred. 36
Grind some of it into fine dust and put this before the commandments in the meeting tent where I
will meet you. This incense shall be treated as most sacred by you. 37 You may not make
incense of a like mixture for yourselves; you must treat it as sacred to the LORD. 38 Whoever
makes an incense like this for his own enjoyment of its fragrance, shall be cut off from his
kinsmen.”
Ex. 31
Choice of Artisans. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “See, I have chosen Bezalel, son of Uri,
son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 3 and I have filled him with a divine spirit of skill and
understanding and knowledge in every craft: 4 in the production of embroidery, in making things
of gold, silver or bronze, 5 in cutting and mounting precious stones, in carving wood, and in
every craft. 6 As his assistant I have appointed Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. I
have also endowed all the experts with the necessary skill to make all the things I have ordered
you to make: 7 the meeting tent, the ark of the commandments with the propitiatory on top of it,
all the furnishings of the tent, 8 the table with its appurtenances, the pure gold lampstand with all
its appurtenances, the altar of incense, 9 the altar of holocausts with all its appurtenances, the
laver with its base, 10 the service cloths, the sacred vestments for Aaron the priest, the vestments
for his sons in their ministry, 11 the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. All
Books of Moses

79

these things they shall make just as I have commanded you.”
Sabbath Laws. 12 The LORD said to Moses, 13 “You must also tell the Israelites: Take
care to keep my sabbaths, for that is to be the token between you and me throughout the
generations, to show that it is I, the LORD, who make you holy. 14 Therefore, you must keep the
sabbath as something sacred. Whoever desecrates it shall be put to death. If anyone does work on
that day, he must be rooted out of his people. 15 Six days there are for doing work, but the
seventh day is the sabbath of complete rest, sacred to the LORD. Anyone who does work on the
sabbath day shall be put to death. 16 So shall the Israelites observe the sabbath, keeping it
throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. 17 Between me and the Israelites it is to be
an everlasting token; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the
seventh day he rested at his ease.”
18 When the LORD had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two
tablets of the commandments, the stone tablets inscribed by God’s own finger.
Ex. 32
The Golden Calf. 1 When the people became aware of Moses’ delay in coming down from
the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who will be
our leader; as for the man Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what
has happened to him.” 2 Aaron replied, “Have your wives and sons and daughters take off the
golden earrings they are wearing, and bring them to me.” 3 So all the people took off their
earrings and brought them to Aaron, 4 who accepted their offering, and fashioning this gold with
a graving tool, made a molten calf. Then they cried out, “This is your God, O Israel, who brought
you out of the land of Egypt.” 5 On seeing this, Aaron built an altar before the calf and
proclaimed, “Tomorrow is a feast of the LORD.” 6 Early the next day the people offered
holocausts and brought peace offerings. Then they sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
revel.
7 With that, the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once to your people, whom you brought
out of the land of Egypt, for they have become depraved. 8 They have soon turned aside from the
way I pointed out to them, making for themselves a molten calf and worshiping it, sacrificing to
it and crying out, ‘This is your God, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!’ 9 I see
how stiff-necked this people is,” continued the LORD to Moses. 10 “Let me alone, then, that my
wrath may blaze up against them to consume them. Then I will make of you a great nation.”
11 But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying, “Why, O LORD, should your wrath
blaze up against your own people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with such great
power and with so strong a hand? 12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought
them out, that he might kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the face of the
earth’? Let your blazing wrath die down; relent in punishing your people. 13 Remember your
servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and how you swore to them by your own self, saying, ‘I will
make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky; and all this land that I promised, I
will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.’” 14 So the LORD relented in the
punishment he had threatened to inflict on his people.
15 Moses then turned and came down the mountain with the two tablets of the
commandments in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, front and back; 16 tablets
that were made by God, having inscriptions on them that were engraved by God himself. 17
Now, when Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “That sounds like a
battle in the camp.” 18 But Moses answered, “It does not sound like cries of victory, nor does it
sound like cries of defeat; the sounds that I hear are cries of revelry.” 19 As he drew near the
camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. With that, Moses’ wrath flared up, so that he threw the
tablets down and broke them on the base of the mountain. 20 Taking the calf they had made, he
fused it in the fire and then ground it down to powder, which he scattered on the water and made
Books of Moses

80

the Israelites drink.
21 Moses asked Aaron, “What did this people ever do to you that you should lead them into
so grave a sin?” Aaron replied, “Let not my lord be angry. 22 You know well enough how prone
the people are to evil. 23 They said to me, ‘Make us a god to be our leader; as for the man Moses
who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’ 24 So I
told them, ‘Let anyone who has gold jewelry take it off.’ They gave it to me, and I threw it into
the fire, and this calf came out.”
25 When Moses realized that, to the scornful joy of their foes, Aaron had let the people run
wild, 26 he stood at the gate of the camp and cried, “Whoever is for the LORD, let him come to
me!” All the Levites then rallied to him, 27 and he told them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of
Israel: Put your sword on your hip, every one of you! Now go up and down the camp, from gate
to gate, and slay your own kinsmen, your friends and neighbors!” 28 The Levites carried out the
command of Moses, and that day there fell about three thousand of the people. 29 Then Moses
said, “Today you have been dedicated to the LORD, for you were against your own sons and
kinsmen, to bring a blessing upon yourselves this day.”
The Atonement. 30 On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a
grave sin. I will go up to the LORD, then; perhaps I may be able to make atonement for your
sin.” 31 So Moses went back to the LORD and said, “Ah, this people has indeed committed a
grave sin in making a god of gold for themselves! 32 If you would only forgive their sin! If you
will not, then strike me out of the book that you have written.” 33 The LORD answered, “Him
only who has sinned against me will I strike out of my book. 34 Now, go and lead the people
whither I have told you. My angel will go before you. When it is time for me to punish, I will
punish them for their sin.”
35 Thus the LORD smote the people for having had Aaron make the calf for them.
Ex. 33
1 The LORD told Moses, “You and the people whom you have brought up from the land of
Egypt, are to go up from here to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob I would
give to their descendants. 2 Driving out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites
and Jebusites, I will send an angel before you 3 to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I
myself will not go up in your company, because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise I might
exterminate you on the way.” 4 When the people heard this bad news, they went into mourning,
and no one wore his ornaments.
5 The LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites: You are a stiff-necked people. Were I to go
up in your company even for a moment, I would exterminate you. Take off your ornaments,
therefore; I will then see what I am to do with you.” 6 So, from Mount Horeb onward, the
Israelites laid aside their ornaments.
Moses’ Intimacy with God. 7 The tent, which was called the meeting tent, Moses used to
pitch at some distance away, outside the camp. Anyone who wished to consult the LORD would
go to this meeting tent outside the camp. 8 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, the people
would all rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents, watching Moses until he entered the
tent. 9 As Moses entered the tent, the column of cloud would come down and stand at its
entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses. 10 On seeing the column of cloud stand at the
entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and worship at the entrance of their own tents. 11
The LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another. Moses would then
return to the camp, but his young assistant, Joshua, son of Nun, would not move out of the tent.
12 Moses said to the LORD, “You, indeed, are telling me to lead this people on; but you
have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘You are my intimate
friend,’ and also, ‘You have found favor with me.’ 13 Now, if I have found favor with you, do let
me know your ways so that, in knowing you, I may continue to find favor with you. Then, too,
Books of Moses

81

this nation is, after all, your own people.” 14 “I myself,” the LORD answered, “will go along, to
give you rest.” 15 Moses replied, “If you are not going yourself, do not make us go up from here.
16 For how can it be known that we, your people and I, have found favor with you, except by
your going with us? Then we, your people and I, will be singled out from every other people on
the earth.” 17 The LORD said to Moses, “This request, too, which you have just made, I will
carry out, because you have found favor with me and you are my intimate friend.”
18 Then Moses said, “Do let me see your glory!” 19 He answered, “I will make all my
beauty pass before you, and in your presence I will pronounce my name, ‘LORD’; I who show
favors to whom I will, I who grant mercy to whom I will. 20 But my face you cannot see, for no
man sees me and still lives. 21 Here,” continued the LORD, “is a place near me where you shall
station yourself on the rock. 22 When my glory passes I will set you in the hollow of the rock
and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 23 Then I will remove my hand, so that
you may see my back; but my face is not to be seen.”
Ex. 34
Renewal of the Tablets. 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Cut two stone tablets like the
former, that I may write on them the commandments which were on the former tablets that you
broke. 2 Get ready for tomorrow morning, when you are to go up Mount Sinai and there present
yourself to me on the top of the mountain. 3 No one shall come up with you, and no one is even
to be seen on any part of the mountain; even the flocks and the herds are not to go grazing
toward this mountain.” 4 Moses then cut two stone tablets like the former, and early the next
morning he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him, taking along the two stone
tablets.
5 Having come down in a cloud, the LORD stood with him there and proclaimed his name,
“LORD.” 6 Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out, “The LORD, the LORD, a
merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity, 7 continuing his
kindness for a thousand generations, and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin; yet not
declaring the guilty guiltless, but punishing children and grandchildren to the third and fourth
generation for their fathers’ wickedness!” 8 Moses at once bowed down to the ground in
worship. 9 Then he said, “If I find favor with you, O Lord, do come along in our company. This
is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive us as your own.”
Religious Laws. 10 “Here, then,” said the LORD, “is the covenant I will make. Before the
eyes of all your people I will work such marvels as have never been wrought in any nation
anywhere on earth, so that this people among whom you live may see how awe-inspiring are the
deeds which I, the LORD, will do at your side. 11 But you, on your part, must keep the
commandments I am giving you today.
“I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and
Jebusites. 12 Take care, therefore, not to make a covenant with these inhabitants of the land that
you are to enter; else they will become a snare among you. 13 Tear down their altars; smash their
sacred pillars, and cut down their sacred poles. 14 You shall not worship any other god, for the
LORD is ‘the Jealous One’; a jealous God is he. 15 Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants
of that land; else, when they render their wanton worship to their gods and sacrifice to them, one
of them may invite you and you may partake of his sacrifice. 16 Neither shall you take their
daughters as wives for your sons; otherwise, when their daughters render their wanton worship to
their gods, they will make your sons do the same.
17 “You shall not make for yourselves molten gods.
18 “You shall keep the feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days at the prescribed time in
the month of Abib you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you; for in the month of
Abib you came out of Egypt.
19 “To me belongs every first-born male that opens the womb among all your livestock,
Books of Moses

82

whether in the herd or in the flock. 20 The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with one of the
flock; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. The first-born among your sons you shall
redeem.
“No one shall appear before me empty-handed.
21 “For six days you may work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; on that day you must
rest even during the seasons of plowing and harvesting.
22 “You shall keep the feast of Weeks with the first of the wheat harvest; likewise, the feast
at the fruit harvest at the close of the year. 23 Three times a year all your men shall appear before
the Lord, the LORD God of Israel. 24 Since I will drive out the nations before you to give you a
large territory, there will be no one to covet your land when you go up three times a year to
appear before the LORD, your God.
25 “You shall not offer me the blood of sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice
of the Passover feast be kept overnight for the next day.
26 “The choicest first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of the LORD, your
God.
“You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.”
Radiance of Moses’ Face. 27 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write down these words, for
in accordance with them I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 28 So Moses stayed
there with the LORD for forty days and forty nights, without eating any food or drinking any
water, and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
29 As Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the commandments in his
hands, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while he conversed with the
LORD. 30 When Aaron, then, and the other Israelites saw Moses and noticed how radiant the
skin of his face had become, they were afraid to come near him. 31 Only after Moses called to
them did Aaron and all the rulers of the community come back to him. Moses then spoke to
them. 32 Later on, all the Israelites came up to him, and he enjoined on them all that the LORD
had told him on Mount Sinai. 33 When he finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his
face. 34 Whenever Moses entered the presence of the LORD to converse with him, he removed
the veil until he came out again. On coming out, he would tell the Israelites all that had been
commanded. 35 Then the Israelites would see that the skin of Moses’ face was radiant; so he
would again put the veil over his face until he went in to converse with the LORD.
Ex. 35
Sabbath Regulations. 1 Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them,
“This is what the LORD has commanded to be done. 2 On six days work may be done, but the
seventh day shall be sacred to you as the sabbath of complete rest to the LORD. Anyone who
does work on that day shall be put to death. 3 You shall not even light a fire in any of your
dwellings on the sabbath day.”
Collection of Materials. 4 Moses told the whole Israelite community, “This is what the
LORD has commanded: 5 Take up among you a collection for the LORD. Everyone, as his heart
prompts him, shall bring, as a contribution to the LORD, gold, silver and bronze; 6 violet, purple
and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair; 7 rams’ skins dyed red, and tahash skins; acacia wood;
8 oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; 9 onyx stones and
other gems for mounting on the ephod and on the breastpiece.
Call for Artisans. 10 “Let every expert among you come and make all that the LORD has
commanded: the Dwelling, 11 with its tent, its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its
columns and its pedestals; 12 the ark, with its poles, the propitiatory, and the curtain veil; 13 the
table, with its poles and all its appurtenances, and the showbread; 14 the lampstand, with its
appurtenances, the lamps, and the oil for the light; 15 the altar of incense, with its poles; the
anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; the entrance curtain for the entrance of the Dwelling; 16
Books of Moses

83

the altar of holocausts, with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its appurtenances; the laver, with
its base; 17 the hangings of the court, with their columns and pedestals; the curtain for the
entrance of the court; 18 the tent pegs for the Dwelling and for the court, with their ropes; 19 the
service cloths for use in the sanctuary; the sacred vestments for Aaron, the priest, and the
vestments worn by his sons in their ministry.”
The Contibution. 20 When the whole Israelite community left Moses’ presence, 21
everyone, as his heart suggested and his spirit prompted, brought a contribution to the LORD for
the construction of the meeting tent, for all its services, and for the sacred vestments. 22 Both the
men and the women, all as their heart prompted them, brought brooches, earrings, rings,
necklaces and various other gold articles. Everyone who could presented an offering of gold to
the LORD. 23 Everyone who happened to have violet, purple or scarlet yarn, fine linen or goat
hair, rams’ skins dyed red or tahash skins, brought them. 24 Whoever could make a contribution
of silver or bronze offered it to the LORD; and everyone who happened to have acacia wood for
any part of the work, brought it. 25 All the women who were expert spinners brought hand-spun
violet, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen thread. 26 All the women who possessed the skill,
spun goat hair. 27 The princes brought onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the ephod
and on the breastpiece; 28 as well as spices, and oil for the light, anointing oil, and fragrant
incense. 29 Every Israelite man and woman brought to the LORD such voluntary offerings as
they thought best, for the various kinds of work which the LORD had commanded Moses to
have done.
The Artisans. 30 Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel, son of
Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 31 and has filled him with a divine spirit of skill and
understanding and knowledge in every craft: 32 in the production of embroidery, in making
things of gold, silver or bronze, 33 in cutting and mounting precious stones, in carving wood, and
in every other craft. 34 He has also given both him and Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe
of Dan, the ability to teach others. 35 He has endowed them with skill to execute all types of
work: engraving, embroidering, the making of variegated cloth of violet, purple and scarlet yarn
and fine linen thread, weaving, and all other arts and crafts.
Ex. 36
1 “Bezalel, therefore, will set to work with Oholiab and with all the experts whom the
LORD has endowed with skill and understanding in knowing how to execute all the work for the
service of the sanctuary, just as the LORD has commanded.”
2 Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and all the other experts whom the LORD had
endowed with skill, men whose hearts moved them to come and take part in the work. 3 They
received from Moses all the contributions which the Israelites had brought for establishing the
service of the sanctuary. Still, morning after morning the people continued to bring their
voluntary offerings to Moses. 4 Thereupon the experts who were executing the various kinds of
work for the sanctuary, all left the work they were doing, 5 and told Moses, “The people are
bringing much more than is needed to carry out the work which the LORD has commanded us to
do.” 6 Moses, therefore, ordered a proclamation to be made throughout the camp: “Let neither
man nor woman make any more contributions for the sanctuary.” So the people stopped bringing
their offerings; 7 there was already enough at hand, in fact, more than enough, to complete the
work to be done.
The Tent Cloth and Coverings. 8 The various experts who were executing the work, made
the Dwelling with its ten sheets woven of fine linen twined, having cherubim embroidered on
them with violet, purple and scarlet yarn. 9 The length of each sheet was twenty-eight cubits, and
the width four cubits; all the sheets were of the same size. 10 Five of the sheets were sewed
together, edge to edge; and the same for the other five. 11 Loops of violet yarn were made along
the edge of the end sheet in the first set, and the same along the edge of the end sheet in the
Books of Moses

84

second set. 12 Fifty loops were thus put on one inner sheet, and fifty loops on the inner sheet in
the other set, with the loops directly opposite each other. 13 Then fifty clasps of gold were made,
with which the sheets were joined so that the Dwelling formed one whole.
14 Sheets of goat hair were also woven as a tent over the Dwelling. Eleven such sheets were
made. 15 The length of each sheet was thirty cubits and the width four cubits; all eleven sheets
were the same size. 16 Five of these sheets were sewed edge to edge into one set; and the other
six sheets into another set. 17 Fifty loops were made along the edge of the end sheet in one set,
and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding sheet in the other set. 18 Fifty bronze clasps
were made with which the tent was joined so that it formed one whole. 19 A covering for the tent
was made of rams’ skins dyed red, and above that, a covering of tahash skins.
The Boards. 20 Boards of acacia wood were made as walls for the Dwelling. 21 The length
of each board was ten cubits, and the width one and a half cubits. 22 Each board had two arms,
fastening them in line. In this way all the boards of the Dwelling were made. 23 They were set
up as follows: twenty boards on the south side, 24 with forty silver pedestals under the twenty
boards, so that there were two pedestals under each board, at its two arms; 25 twenty boards on
the other side of the Dwelling, the north side, 26 with their forty silver pedestals, two under each
board; 27 six boards at the rear of the Dwelling, to the west; 28 and two boards at the corners in
the rear of the Dwelling. 29 These were double at the bottom, and likewise double at the top, to
the first ring. That is how both boards in the corners were made. 30 Thus, there were in the rear
eight boards, with their sixteen silver pedestals, two pedestals under each board. 31 Bars of
acacia wood were also made, five for the boards on one side of the Dwelling, 32 five for those on
the other side, and five for those at the rear, to the west. 33 The center bar, at the middle of the
boards, was made to reach across from end to end. 34 The boards were plated with gold, and
gold rings were made on them as holders for the bars, which were also plated with gold.
The Veil. 35 The veil was woven of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, and of fine linen twined,
with cherubim embroidered on it. 36 Four gold-plated columns of acacia wood, with gold hooks,
were made for it, and four silver pedestals were cast for them.
37 The curtain for the entrance of the tent was made of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, and of
fine linen twined, woven in a variegated manner. 38 Its five columns, with their hooks as well as
their capitals and bands, were plated with gold; their five pedestals were of bronze.
Ex. 37
The Ark. 1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, one and a half
cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 2 The inside and outside were plated with gold, and a
molding of gold was put around it. 3 Four gold rings were cast and put on its four supports, two
rings for one side and two for the opposite side. 4 Poles of acacia wood were made and plated
with gold; 5 these were put through the rings on the sides of the ark, for carrying it.
6 The propitiatory was made of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half
cubits wide. 7 Two cherubim of beaten gold were made for the two ends of the propitiatory, 8
one cherub fastened at one end, the other at the other end, springing directly from the
propitiatory at its two ends. 9 The cherubim had their wings spread out above, covering the
propitiatory with them. They were turned toward each other, but with their faces looking toward
the propitiatory.
The Table. 10 The table was made of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one
and a half cubits high. 11 It was plated with pure gold, and a molding of gold was put around it.
12 A frame a handbreadth high was also put around it, with a molding of gold around the frame.
13 Four rings of gold were cast for it and fastened, one at each of the four corners. 14 The rings
were alongside the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table. 15 These poles were made of
acacia wood and plated with gold. 16 The vessels that were set on the table, its plates and cups,
as well as its pitchers and bowls for pouring libations, were of pure gold.
Books of Moses

85

The Lampstand. 17 The lampstand was made of pure beaten gold—its shaft and branches
as well as its cups and knobs and petals springing directly from it. 18 Six branches extended
from its sides, three branches on one side and three on the other. 19 On one branch there were
three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and petals; on the opposite branch
there were three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and petals; and so for the
six branches that extended from the lampstand. 20 On the shaft there were four cups, shaped like
almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals, 21 including a knob below each of the three pairs
of branches that extended from the lampstand. 22 The knobs and branches sprang so directly
from it that the whole formed but a single piece of pure beaten gold. 23 Its seven lamps, as well
as its trimming shears and trays, were made of pure gold. 24 A talent of pure gold was used for
the lampstand and its various appurtenances.
The Altar of Incense. 25 The altar of incense was made of acacia wood, on a square, a
cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high, having horns that sprang directly from it. 26 Its
grate on top, its walls on all four sides, and its horns were plated with pure gold; and a molding
of gold was put around it. 27 Underneath the molding gold rings were placed, two on one side
and two on the opposite side, as holders for the poles to carry it. 28 The poles, too, were made of
acacia wood and plated with gold.
29 The sacred anointing oil and the fragrant incense were prepared in their pure form by a
perfumer.
Ex. 38
The Altar of Holocausts. 1 The altar of holocausts was made of acacia wood, on a square,
five cubits long and five cubits wide; its height was three cubits. 2 At the four corners horns were
made that sprang directly from the altar. The whole was plated with bronze. 3 All the utensils of
the altar, the pots, shovels, basins, forks and fire pans, were likewise made of bronze. 4 A grating
of bronze network was made for the altar and placed round it, on the ground, half as high as the
altar itself. 5 Four rings were cast for the four corners of the bronze grating, as holders for the
poles, 6 which were made of acacia wood and plated with bronze. 7 The poles were put through
the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. The altar was made in the form of a hollow box.
The Laver. 8 The bronze laver, with its bronze base, was made from the mirrors of the
women who served at the entrance of the meeting tent.
The Court. 9 The court was made as follows. On the south side of the court there were
hangings, woven of fine linen twined, a hundred cubits long, 10 with twenty columns and twenty
pedestals of bronze, the hooks and bands of the columns being of silver. 11 On the north side
there were similar hangings, one hundred cubits long, with twenty columns and twenty pedestals
of bronze, the hooks and bands of the columns being of silver. 12 On the west side there were
hangings, fifty cubits long, with ten columns and ten pedestals, the hooks and bands of the
columns being of silver. 13 On the east side the court was fifty cubits long. 14 Toward one side
there were hangings to the extent of fifteen cubits, with three columns and three pedestals;
toward the other side, 15 beyond the entrance of the court, there were likewise hangings to the
extent of fifteen cubits, with three columns and three pedestals. 16 The hangings on all sides of
the court were woven of fine linen twined. 17 The pedestals of the columns were of bronze,
while the hooks and bands of the columns were of silver; the capitals were silver-plated, and all
the columns of the court were banded with silver.
18 At the entrance of the court there was a variegated curtain, woven of violet, purple and
scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined, twenty cubits long and five cubits wide, in keeping with the
hangings of the court. 19 There were four columns and four pedestals of bronze for it, while their
hooks were of silver. 20 All the tent pegs for the Dwelling and for the court around it were of
bronze.
Amount of Metal Used. 21 The following is an account of the various amounts used on the
Books of Moses

86

Dwelling, the Dwelling of the commandments, drawn up at the command of Moses by the
Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. 22 However, it was Bezalel, son
of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who made all that the Lord commanded Moses, 23 and
he was assisted by Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, who was an engraver, an
embroiderer, and a weaver of variegated cloth of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine linen.
24 All the gold used in the entire construction of the sanctuary, having previously been
given as an offering, amounted to twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels,
according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel. 25 The amount of the silver received from the
community was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels,
according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel; 26 one bekah apiece, that is, a half-shekel
apiece, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel, was received from every man of twenty
years or more who entered the registered group; the number of these was six hundred and three
thousand five hundred and fifty men. 27 One hundred talents of silver were used for casting the
pedestals of the sanctuary and the pedestals of the veil, one talent for each pedestal, or one
hundred talents for the one hundred pedestals. 28 The remaining one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five shekels were used for making the hooks on the columns, for plating the capitals,
and for banding them with silver. 29 The bronze, given as an offering, amounted to seventy
talents and two thousand four hundred shekels. 30 With this were made the pedestals at the
entrance of the meeting tent, the bronze altar with its bronze gratings and all the appurtenances
of the altar, 31 the pedestals around the court, the pedestals at the entrance of the court, and all
the tent pegs for the Dwelling and for the court around it.
Ex. 39
The Vestments. 1 With violet, purple and scarlet yarn were woven the service cloths for
use in the sanctuary, as well as the sacred vestments for Aaron, as the LORD had commanded
Moses.
2 The ephod was woven of gold thread and of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine
linen twined. 3 Gold was first hammered into gold leaf and then cut up into threads, which were
woven with the violet, purple and scarlet yarn into an embroidered pattern on the fine linen. 4
Shoulder straps were made for it and joined to its two upper ends. 5 The embroidered belt on the
ephod extended out from it, and like it, was made of gold thread, of violet, purple and scarlet
yarn, and of fine linen twined, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 6 The onyx stones were
prepared and mounted in gold filigree work; they were engraved like seal engravings with the
names of the sons of Israel. 7 These stones were set on the shoulder straps of the ephod as
memorial stones of the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
8 The breastpiece was embroidered like the ephod, with gold thread and violet, purple and
scarlet yarn on cloth of fine linen twined. 9 It was square and folded double, a span high and a
span wide in its folded form. 10 Four rows of precious stones were mounted on it: in the first row
a carnelian, a topaz and an emerald; 11 in the second row, a garnet, a sapphire and a beryl; 12 in
the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst; 13 in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a
jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree work. 14 These stones were twelve, to match the
names of the sons of Israel, and each stone was engraved like a seal with the name of one of the
twelve tribes.
15 Chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, were made for the breastpiece, 16 together with
two gold filigree rosettes and two gold rings. The two rings were fastened to the two upper ends
of the breastpiece. 17 The two gold chains were then fastened to the two rings at the ends of the
breastpiece. 18 The other two ends of the two chains were fastened in front to the two filigree
rosettes, which were attached to the shoulder straps of the ephod. 19 Two other gold rings were
made and put on the two lower ends of the breastpiece, on the edge facing the ephod. 20 Two
more gold rings were made and fastened to the bottom of the two shoulder straps next to where
Books of Moses

87

they joined the ephod in front, just above its embroidered belt. 21 Violet ribbons bound the rings
of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod, so that the breastpiece stayed right above the
embroidered belt of the ephod and did not swing loose from it. All this was just as the LORD had
commanded Moses.
The Other Vestments. 22 The robe of the ephod was woven entirely of violet yarn, 23 with
an opening in its center like the opening of a shirt, with selvage around the opening to keep it
from being torn. 24 At the hem of the robe pomegranates were made of violet, purple and scarlet
yarn and of fine linen twined; 25 bells of pure gold were also made and put between the
pomegranates all around the hem of the robe: 26 first a bell, then a pomegranate, and thus
alternating all around the hem of the robe which was to be worn in performing the ministry—all
this, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
27 For Aaron and his sons there were also woven tunics of fine linen; 28 the miter of fine
linen; the ornate turbans of fine linen; drawers of linen (of fine linen twined); 29 and sashes of
variegated work made of fine linen twined and of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, as the LORD
had commanded Moses. 30 The plate of the sacred diadem was made of pure gold and inscribed,
as on a seal engraving: “Sacred to the LORD.” 31 It was tied over the miter with a violet ribbon,
as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Presentation of the Work to Moses. 32 Thus the entire work of the Dwelling of the
meeting tent was completed. The Israelites did the work just as the LORD had commanded
Moses. 33 They then brought to Moses the Dwelling, the tent with all its appurtenances, the
clasps, the boards, the bars, the columns, the pedestals, 34 the covering of rams’ skins dyed red,
the covering of tahash skins, the curtain veil; 35 the ark of the commandments with its poles, the
propitiatory, 36 the table with all its appurtenances and the showbread, 37 the pure gold
lampstand with its lamps set up on it and with all its appurtenances, the oil for the light, 38 the
golden altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the tent, 39 the
altar of bronze with its bronze grating, its poles and all its appurtenances, the laver with its base,
40 the hangings of the court with their columns and pedestals, the curtain for the entrance of the
court with its ropes and tent pegs, all the equipment for the service of the Dwelling of the
meeting tent; 41 the service cloths for use in the sanctuary, the sacred vestments for Aaron the
priest, and the vestments to be worn by his sons in their ministry. 42 The Israelites had carried
out all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 43 So when Moses saw that all the
work was done just as the LORD had commanded, he blessed them.
Ex. 40
Erection of the Dwelling. 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, 2 “On the first day of the first
month you shall erect the Dwelling of the meeting tent. 3 Put the ark of the commandments in it,
and screen off the ark with the veil. 4 Bring in the table and set it. Then bring in the lampstand
and set up the lamps on it. 5 Put the golden altar of incense in front of the ark of the
commandments, and hang the curtain at the entrance of the Dwelling. 6 Put the altar of
holocausts in front of the entrance of the Dwelling of the meeting tent. 7 Place the laver between
the meeting tent and the altar, and put water in it. 8 Set up the court round about, and put the
curtain at the entrance of the court.
9 “Take the anointing oil and anoint the Dwelling and everything in it, consecrating it and
all its furnishings, so that it will be sacred. 10 Anoint the altar of holocausts and all its
appurtenances, consecrating it, so that it will be most sacred. 11 Likewise, anoint the laver with
its base, and thus consecrate it.
12 “Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the meeting tent, and there wash them
with water. 13 Clothe Aaron with the sacred vestments and anoint him, thus consecrating him as
my priest. 14 Bring forward his sons also, and clothe them with the tunics. 15 As you have
anointed their father, anoint them also as my priests. Thus, by being anointed, shall they receive
Books of Moses

88

a perpetual priesthood throughout all future generations.”
16 Moses did exactly as the LORD had commanded him. 17 On the first day of the first
month of the second year the Dwelling was erected. 18 It was Moses who erected the Dwelling.
He placed its pedestals, set up its boards, put in its bars, and set up its columns. 19 He spread the
tent over the Dwelling and put the covering on top of the tent, as the LORD had commanded
him. 20 He took the commandments and put them in the ark; he placed poles alongside the ark
and set the propitiatory upon it. 21 He brought the ark into the Dwelling and hung the curtain
veil, thus screening off the ark of the commandments, as the LORD had commanded him. 22 He
put the table in the meeting tent, on the north side of the Dwelling, outside the veil, 23 and
arranged the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded him. 24 He placed the
lampstand in the meeting tent, opposite the table, on the south side of the Dwelling, 25 and he set
up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded him. 26 He placed the golden
altar in the meeting tent, in front of the veil, 27 and on it he burned fragrant incense, as the
LORD had commanded him. 28 He hung the curtain at the entrance of the Dwelling. 29 He put
the altar of holocausts in front of the entrance of the Dwelling of the meeting tent, and offered
holocausts and cereal offerings on it, as the LORD had commanded him. 30 He placed the laver
between the meeting tent and the altar, and put water in it for washing. 31 Moses and Aaron and
his sons used to wash their hands and feet there, 32 for they washed themselves whenever they
went into the meeting tent or approached the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 33
Finally, he set up the court around the Dwelling and the altar and hung the curtain at the entrance
of the court. Thus Moses finished all the work.
God’s Presence in the Dwelling. 34 Then the cloud covered the meeting tent, and the glory
of the LORD filled the Dwelling. 35 Moses could not enter the meeting tent, because the cloud
settled down upon it and the glory of the LORD filled the Dwelling. 36 Whenever the cloud rose
from the Dwelling, the Israelites would set out on their journey. 37 But if the cloud did not lift,
they would not go forward; only when it lifted did they go forward. 38 In the daytime the cloud
of the LORD was seen over the Dwelling; whereas at night, fire was seen in the cloud by the
whole house of Israel in all the stages of their journey.

LEVITICUS
I. RITUAL OF SACRIFICES
Lev. 1
Holocausts. 1 The LORD called Moses, and from the meeting tent gave him this message:
2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any one of you wishes to bring an animal offering
to the LORD, such an offering must be from the herd or from the flock.
3 “If his holocaust offering is from the herd, it must be a male without blemish. To find
favor with the LORD, he shall bring it to the entrance of the meeting tent 4 and there lay his
hand on the head of the holocaust, so that it may be acceptable to make atonement for him. 5 He
shall then slaughter the bull before the LORD, but Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall offer up its
blood by splashing it on the sides of the altar which is at the entrance of the meeting tent. 6 Then
he shall skin the holocaust and cut it up into pieces. 7 After Aaron’s sons, the priests, have put
some burning embers on the altar and laid some wood on them, 8 they shall lay the pieces of
meat, together with the head and the suet, on top of the wood and embers on the altar. 9 The
inner organs and the shanks, however, the offerer shall first wash with water. The priest shall
then burn the whole offering on the altar as a holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
10 “If his holocaust offering is from the flock, that is, a sheep or a goat, he must bring a
male without blemish. 11 This he shall slaughter before the LORD at the north side of the altar.
Then Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall splash its blood on the sides of the altar. 12 When the
offerer has cut it up into pieces, the priest shall lay these, together with the head and suet, on top
of the wood and the fire on the altar. 13 The inner organs and the shanks, however, the offerer
shall first wash with water. The priest shall offer them up and then burn the whole offering on
the altar as a holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
14 “If he offers a bird as a holocaust to the LORD, he shall choose a turtledove or a pigeon
as his offering. 15 Having brought it to the altar where it is to be burned, the priest shall snap its
head loose and squeeze out its blood against the side of the altar. 16 Its crop and feathers shall be
removed and thrown on the ash heap at the east side of the altar. 17 Then, having split the bird
down the middle without separating the halves, the priest shall burn it on the altar, over the wood
on the fire, as a holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
Lev. 2
Cereal Offerings. 1 “When anyone wishes to bring a cereal offering to the LORD, his
offering must consist of fine flour. He shall pour oil on it and put frankincense over it. 2 When
he has brought it to Aaron’s sons, the priests, one of them shall take a handful of this fine flour
and oil, together with all the frankincense, and this he shall burn on the altar as a token offering,
a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 3 The rest of the cereal offering belongs to Aaron and
his sons. It is a most sacred oblation to the LORD.
4 “When the cereal offering you present is baked in an oven, it must be in the form of
unleavened cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil, or of unleavened wafers spread with oil. 5 If
you present a cereal offering that is fried on a griddle, it must be of fine flour mixed with oil and
unleavened. 6 Such a cereal offering must be broken into pieces, and oil must be poured over it.
7 If you present a cereal offering that is prepared in a pot, it must be of fine flour, deep-fried in
oil. 8 A cereal offering that is made in any of these ways you shall bring to the LORD, offering it
to the priest, who shall take it to the altar. 9 Its token offering the priest shall then lift from the
cereal offering and burn on the altar as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 10 The rest of
the cereal offering belongs to Aaron and his sons. It is a most sacred oblation to the LORD.
11 “Every cereal offering that you present to the LORD shall be unleavened, for you shall
not burn any leaven or honey as an oblation to the LORD. 12 Such you may indeed present to the
LORD in the offering of first fruits, but they are not to be placed on the altar for a pleasing odor.
Books of Moses

90

13 However, every cereal offering that you present to the LORD shall be seasoned with salt. Do
not let the salt of the covenant of your God be lacking from your cereal offering. On every
offering you shall offer salt.
14 “If you present a cereal offering of first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer it in the form
of fresh grits of new ears of grain, roasted by fire. 15 On this cereal offering you shall put oil and
frankincense. 16 For its token offering the priest shall then burn some of the grits and oil,
together with all the frankincense, as an oblation to the LORD.
Lev. 3
Peace Offerings. 1 “If someone in presenting a peace offering makes his offering from the
herd, he may offer before the LORD either a male or a female animal, but it must be without
blemish. 2 He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and then slaughter it at the entrance
of the meeting tent; but Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall splash its blood on the sides of the altar. 3
From the peace offering he shall offer as an oblation to the LORD the fatty membrane over the
inner organs, and all the fat that adheres to them, 4 as well as the two kidneys, with the fat on
them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall sever above the kidneys. 5 All this
Aaron’s sons shall then burn on the altar with the holocaust, on the wood over the fire, as a
sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
6 “If the peace offering he presents to the LORD is from the flock, he may offer either a
male or a female animal, but it must be without blemish. 7 If he presents a lamb as his offering,
he shall bring it before the LORD, 8 and after laying his hand on the head of his offering, he
shall slaughter it before the meeting tent; but Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood on the sides of
the altar. 9 As an oblation to the LORD he shall present the fat of the peace offering: the whole
fatty tail, which he must sever close to the spine, the fatty membrane over the inner organs, and
all the fat that adheres to them, 10 as well as the two kidneys, with the fat on them near the loins,
and the lobe of the liver, which he must sever above the kidneys. 11 All this the priest shall burn
on the altar as the food of the LORD’S oblation.
12 “If he presents a goat, he shall bring it before the LORD, 13 and after laying his hand on
its head, he shall slaughter it before the meeting tent; but Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood on
the sides of the altar. 14 From it he shall offer as an oblation to the LORD the fatty membrane
over the inner organs, and all the fat that adheres to them, 15 as well as the two kidneys, with the
fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he must sever above the kidneys. 16
All this the priest shall burn on the altar as the food of the sweet-smelling oblation. All the fat
belongs to the LORD. 17 This shall be a perpetual ordinance for your descendants wherever they
may dwell. You shall not partake of any fat or any blood.”
Lev. 4
Sin Offerings: For Priests. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites: When a
person inadvertently commits a sin against some command of the LORD by doing one of the
forbidden things, 3 if it is the anointed priest who thus sins and thereby makes the people also
become guilty, he shall present to the LORD a young, unblemished bull as a sin offering for the
sin he committed. 4 Bringing the bullock to the entrance of the meeting tent, before the LORD,
he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the LORD. 5 The anointed priest shall
then take some of the bullock’s blood and bring it into the meeting tent, 6 where, dipping his
finger in the blood, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, toward the veil of the
sanctuary. 7 The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant
incense which is before the LORD in the meeting tent. The rest of the bullock’s blood he shall
pour out at the base of the altar of holocausts which is at the entrance of the meeting tent. 8 From
the sin-offering bullock he shall remove all the fat: the fatty membrane over the inner organs,
and all the fat that adheres to them, 9 as well as the two kidneys, with the fat on them near the
Books of Moses

91

loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he must sever above the kidneys. 10 This is the same as is
removed from the ox of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn it on the altar of holocausts.
11 The hide of the bullock and all its flesh, with its head, legs, inner organs and offal, 12 in short,
the whole bullock, shall be brought outside the camp to a clean place where the ashes are
deposited and there be burned up in a wood fire. At the place of the ash heap, there it must be
burned.
For the Community. 13 “If the whole community of Israel inadvertently and without even
being aware of it does something that the LORD has forbidden and thus makes itself guilty, 14
should it later on become known that the sin was committed, the community shall present a
young bull as a sin offering. They shall bring it before the meeting tent, 15 and here, before the
LORD, the elders of the community shall lay their hands on the bullock’s head. When the
bullock has been slaughtered before the LORD, 16 the anointed priest shall bring some of its
blood into the meeting tent, 17 and dipping his finger in the blood, he shall sprinkle it seven
times before the LORD, toward the veil. 18 He shall also put some of the blood on the horns of
the altar of fragrant incense which is before the LORD in the meeting tent. The rest of the blood
he shall pour out at the base of the altar of holocausts which is at the entrance of the meeting
tent. 19 All of its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar, 20 doing with this bullock just as
he did with the other sin-offering bullock. Thus the priest shall make atonement for them, and
they will be forgiven. 21 This bullock must also be brought outside the camp and burned, just as
has been prescribed for the other one. This is the sin offering for the community.
For the Princes. 22 “Should a prince commit a sin inadvertently by doing one of the things
which are forbidden by some commandment of the LORD, his God, and thus become guilty, 23
if later on he learns of the sin he committed, he shall bring as his offering an unblemished male
goat. 24 Having laid his hands on its head, he shall slaughter the goat as a sin offering before the
LORD, in the place where the holocausts are slaughtered. 25 The priest shall then take some of
the blood of the sin offering on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of holocausts. The
rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of this altar. 26 All of the fat he shall burn on the
altar like the fat of the peace offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for the prince’s sin,
and it will be forgiven.
For Private Persons. 27 “If a private person commits a sin inadvertently by doing one of
the things which are forbidden by the commandments of the LORD, and thus becomes guilty, 28
should he later on learn of the sin he committed, he shall bring an unblemished she-goat as the
offering for his sin. 29 Having laid his hand on the head of the sin offering, he shall slaughter it
at the place of the holocausts. 30 The priest shall then take some of its blood on his finger and
put it on the horns of the altar of holocausts. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of
the altar. 31 All the fat shall be removed, just as the fat is removed from the peace offering, and
the priest shall burn it on the altar for an odor pleasing to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make
atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
32 “If, however, for his sin offering he presents a lamb, he shall bring an unblemished
female. 33 Having laid his hand on its head, he shall slaughter this sin offering in the place where
the holocausts are slaughtered. 34 The priest shall then take some of the blood of the sin offering
on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of holocausts. The rest of the blood he shall pour
out at the base of the altar. 35 All the fat shall be removed, just as the fat is removed from the
peace-offering lamb, and the priest shall burn it on the altar with the other oblations of the
LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for the man’s sin, and it will be forgiven.
Lev. 5
For Special Cases. 1 “If any person refuses to give the information which, as a witness of
something he has seen or learned, he has been adjured to give, and thus commits a sin and has
guilt to bear; 2 or if someone, without being aware of it, touches any unclean thing, as the
Books of Moses

92

carcass of an unclean wild animal, or that of an unclean domestic animal, or that of an unclean
swarming creature, and thus becomes unclean and guilty; 3 or if someone, without being aware
of it, touches some human uncleanness, whatever kind of uncleanness this may be, and then
recognizes his guilt; 4 or if someone, without being aware of it, rashly utters an oath to do good
or evil, such as men are accustomed to utter rashly, and then recognizes that he is guilty of such
an oath; 5 then whoever is guilty in any of these cases shall confess the sin he has incurred, 6 and
as his sin offering for the sin he has committed he shall bring to the LORD a female animal from
the flock, a ewe lamb or a she-goat. The priest shall then make atonement for his sin.
7 “If, however, he cannot afford an animal of the flock, he shall bring to the LORD as the
sin offering for his sin two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a
holocaust. 8 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer the one for the sin offering first.
Snapping its head loose at the neck, yet without breaking it off completely, 9 he shall sprinkle
some of the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar. The rest of the blood shall be
squeezed out against the base of the altar. Such is the offering for sin. 10 The other bird shall be
offered as a holocaust in the usual way. Thus the priest shall make atonement for the sin the man
committed, and it will be forgiven.
11 “If he is unable to afford even two turtledoves or two pigeons, he shall present as a sin
offering for his sin one tenth of an ephah of fine flour. He shall not put oil or frankincense on it,
because it is a sin offering. 12 When he has brought it to the priest, the latter shall take a handful
of this flour as a token offering, and this he shall burn as a sin offering on the altar with the other
oblations of the LORD. 13 Thus the priest shall make atonement for the sin that the man
committed in any of the above cases, and it will be forgiven. The rest of the flour, like the cereal
offerings, shall belong to the priest.”
Guilt Offerings. 14 The LORD said to Moses, 15 “If someone commits a sin by
inadvertently cheating in the LORD’S sacred dues, he shall bring to the LORD as his guilt
offering an unblemished ram from the flock, valued at two silver shekels according to the
standard of the sanctuary shekel. 16 He shall also restore what he has sinfully withheld from the
sanctuary, adding to it a fifth of its value. This is to be given to the priest, who shall then make
atonement for him with the guilt-offering ram, and he will be forgiven.
17 “If someone, without being aware of it, commits such a sin by doing one of the things
which are forbidden by some commandment of the LORD, that he incurs guilt for which he must
answer, 18 he shall bring as a guilt offering to the priest an unblemished ram of the flock of the
established value. The priest shall then make atonement for the fault which was unwittingly
committed, and it will be forgiven. 19 Such is the offering for guilt; the penalty of the guilt must
be paid to the LORD.”
20 The LORD said to Moses, 21 “If someone commits a sin of dishonesty against the LORD
by denying his neighbor a deposit or a pledge for a stolen article, or by otherwise retaining his
neighbor’s goods unjustly, 22 or if, having found a lost article, he denies the fact and swears
falsely about it with any of the sinful oaths that men make in such cases, 23 he shall therefore,
since he has incurred guilt by his sin, restore the thing that was stolen or unjustly retained by him
or the deposit left with him or the lost article he found 24 or whatever else he swore falsely
about; on the day of his guilt offering he shall make full restitution of the thing itself, and in
addition, give the owner one fifth of its value. 25 As his guilt offering he shall bring to the
LORD an unblemished ram of the flock of the established value. When he has presented this as
his guilt offering to the priest, 26 the latter shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and
he will be forgiven whatever guilt he may have incurred.”
Lev. 6
The Daily Holocaust. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Give Aaron and his sons the
following command: This is the ritual for holocausts. The holocaust is to remain on the hearth of
Books of Moses

93

the altar all night until the next morning, and the fire is to be kept burning on the altar. 3 The
priest, clothed in his linen robe and wearing linen drawers on his body, shall take away the ashes
to which the fire has reduced the holocaust on the altar, and lay them at the side of the altar. 4
Then, having taken off these garments and put on other garments, he shall carry the ashes to a
clean place outside the camp. 5 The fire on the altar is to be kept burning; it must not go out.
Every morning the priest shall put firewood on it. On this he shall lay out the holocaust and burn
the fat of the peace offerings. 6 The fire is to be kept burning continuously on the altar; it must
not go out.
Daily Cereal Offerings. 7 “This is the ritual of the cereal offering. One of Aaron’s sons
shall first present it before the LORD, in front of the altar. 8 Then he shall take from it a handful
of its fine flour and oil, together with all the frankincense that is on it, and this he shall burn on
the altar as its token offering, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 9 The rest of it Aaron and
his sons may eat; but it must be eaten in the form of unleavened cakes and in a sacred place: in
the court of the meeting tent they shall eat it. 10 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it
to them as their portion from the oblations of the LORD; it is most sacred, like the sin offering
and the guilt offering. 11 All the male descendants of Aaron may partake of it as their rightful
share in the oblations of the LORD perpetually throughout your generations. Whatever touches
the oblations becomes sacred.”
12 The LORD said to Moses, 13 “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall present
to the LORD (on the day he is anointed): one tenth of an ephah of fine flour for the established
cereal offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. 14 It shall be well kneaded and fried
in oil on a griddle when you bring it in. Having broken the offering into pieces, you shall present
it as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 15 Aaron’s descendant who succeeds him as the
anointed priest shall do likewise. This is a perpetual ordinance: for the Lord the whole offering
shall be burned. 16 Every cereal offering of a priest shall be a whole burnt offering; it may not be
eaten.”
Sin Offerings. 17 The LORD said to Moses, 18 “Tell Aaron and his sons: This is the ritual
for sin offerings. At the place where holocausts are slaughtered, there also, before the LORD,
shall the sin offering be slaughtered. It is most sacred. 19 The priest who presents the sin offering
may partake of it; but it must be eaten in a sacred place, in the court of the meeting tent. 20
Whatever touches its flesh shall become sacred. If any of its blood is spilled on a garment, the
stained part must be washed in a sacred place. 21 A clay vessel in which it has been cooked shall
thereafter be broken; if it is cooked in a bronze vessel, this shall be scoured afterward and rinsed
with water. 22 All the males of the priestly line may partake of the sin offering, since it is most
sacred. 23 But no one may partake of any sin offering of which some blood has been brought
into the meeting tent to make atonement in the sanctuary; such an offering must be burned up in
the fire.
Lev. 7
Guilt Offerings. 1 “This is the ritual for guilt offerings, which are most sacred. 2 At the
place where the holocausts are slaughtered, there also shall the guilt offering be slaughtered. Its
blood shall be splashed on the sides of the altar. 3 All of its fat shall be taken from it and offered
up: the fatty tail, the fatty membrane over the inner organs, 4 as well as the two kidneys with the
fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which must be severed above the kidneys. 5
All this the priest shall burn on the altar as an oblation to the LORD. This is the guilt offering. 6
All the males of the priestly line may partake of it; but it must be eaten in a sacred place, since it
is most sacred.
7 “Because the sin offering and the guilt offering are alike, both having the same ritual, the
guilt offering likewise belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it. 8 Similarly, the priest
who offers a holocaust for someone may keep for himself the hide of the holocaust that he has
Books of Moses

94

offered. 9 Also, every cereal offering that is baked in an oven or deep-fried in a pot or fried on a
griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it, 10 whereas all cereal offerings that are offered up
dry or mixed with oil shall belong to all of Aaron’s sons without distinction.
Peace Offerings. 11 “This is the ritual for the peace offerings that are presented to the
LORD. 12 When anyone makes a peace offering in thanksgiving, together with his thanksgiving
sacrifice he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and
cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil and well kneaded. 13 His offering shall also include
loaves of leavened bread along with the victim of his peace offering for thanksgiving. 14 From
each of his offerings he shall present one portion as a contribution to the LORD; this shall belong
to the priest who splashes the blood of the peace offering.
15 “The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice shall be eaten on the day it is offered; none of it
may be kept till the next day. 16 However, if the sacrifice is a votive or a free-will offering, it
should indeed be eaten on the day the sacrifice is offered, but what is left over may be eaten on
the next day. 17 Should any flesh from the sacrifice be left over on the third day, it must be
burned up in the fire. 18 If, therefore, any of the flesh of the peace offering is eaten on the third
day, it shall not win favor for him nor shall it be reckoned to his credit; rather, it shall be
considered as refuse, and anyone who eats of it shall have his guilt to bear. 19 Should the flesh
touch anything unclean, it may not be eaten, but shall be burned up in the fire. “
All who are clean may partake of this flesh. 20 If, however, someone while in a state of
uncleanness eats any of the flesh of a peace offering belonging to the LORD, that person shall be
cut off from his people. 21 Likewise, if someone touches anything unclean, whether the
uncleanness be of human or of animal origin or from some loathsome crawling creature, and then
eats of a peace offering belonging to the LORD, that person, too, shall be cut off from his
people.”
Prohibition Against Blood and Fat. 22 The LORD said to Moses, 23 “Tell the Israelites:
You shall not eat the fat of any ox or sheep or goat. 24 Although the fat of an animal that has
died a natural death or has been killed by wild beasts may be put to any other use, you may not
eat it. 25 If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which an oblation is made to the LORD, such a
one shall be cut off from his people. 26 Wherever you dwell, you shall not partake of any blood,
be it of bird or of animal. 27 Every person who partakes of any blood shall be cut off from his
people.”
The Portions for Priests. 28 The LORD said to Moses, 29 “Tell the Israelites: He who
presents a peace offering to the LORD shall bring a part of it as his special offering to him, 30
carrying in with his own hands the oblations to the LORD. The fat is to be brought in, together
with the breast, which is to be waved as a wave offering before the LORD. 31 The priest shall
burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. 32 Moreover, from your
peace offering you shall give to the priest the right leg as a raised offering. 33 The descendant of
Aaron who offers up the blood and fat of the peace offering shall have the right leg as his
portion, 34 for from the peace offerings of the Israelites I have taken the breast that is waved and
the leg that is raised up, and I have given them to Aaron, the priest, and to his sons by a perpetual
ordinance as a contribution from the Israelites.”
35 This is the priestly share from the oblations of the LORD, allotted to Aaron and his sons
on the day he called them to be the priests of the LORD; 36 on the day he anointed them the
LORD ordered the Israelites to give them this share by a perpetual ordinance throughout their
generations.
37 This is the ritual for holocausts, cereal offerings, sin offerings, guilt offerings, (ordination
offerings) and peace offerings, 38 which the LORD enjoined on Moses at Mount Sinai at the
time when he commanded the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai to bring their offerings to the
LORD.

II. CEREMONY OF ORDINATION
Lev. 8
Ordination of Aaron and His Sons. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Take Aaron and his
sons, together with the vestments, the anointing oil, the bullock for a sin offering, the two rams,
and the basket of unleavened food. 3 Then assemble the whole community at the entrance of the
meeting tent.” 4 And Moses did as the LORD had commanded. When the community had
assembled at the entrance of the meeting tent, 5 Moses told them what the LORD had ordered to
be done. 6 Bringing forward Aaron and his sons, he first washed them with water. 7 Then he put
the tunic on Aaron, girded him with the sash, clothed him with the robe, placed the ephod on
him, and girded him with the embroidered belt of the ephod, fastening it around him. 8 He then
set the breastpiece on him, with the Urim and Thummim in it, 9 and put the miter on his head,
attaching the gold plate, the sacred diadem, over the front of the miter, at his forehead, as the
LORD had commanded him to do.
10 Taking the anointing oil, Moses anointed and consecrated the Dwelling, with all that was
in it. 11 Then he sprinkled some of this oil seven times on the altar, and anointed the altar, with
all its appurtenances, and the laver, with its base, thus consecrating them. 12 He also poured
some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, thus consecrating him. 13 Moses likewise brought
forward Aaron’s sons, clothed them with tunics, girded them with sashes, and put turbans on
them, as the LORD had commanded him to do.
Ordination Sacrifices. 14 When he had brought forward the bullock for a sin offering,
Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 15 Then Moses slaughtered it, and taking some
of its blood, with his finger he put it on the horns around the altar, thus purifying the altar. He
also made atonement for the altar by pouring out the blood at its base when he consecrated it. 16
Taking all the fat that was over the inner organs, as well as the lobe of the liver and the two
kidneys with their fat, Moses burned them on the altar. 17 The bullock, however, with its hide
and flesh and offal he burned in the fire outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded him to
do.
18 He next brought forward the holocaust ram, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on
its head. 19 When he had slaughtered it, Moses splashed its blood on all sides of the altar. 20
After cutting up the ram into pieces, he burned the head, the cut-up pieces and the suet; 21 then,
having washed the inner organs and the shanks with water, he also burned these remaining parts
of the ram on the altar as a holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD, as the LORD had
commanded him to do.
22 Then he brought forward the second ram, the ordination ram, and Aaron and his sons laid
their hands on its head. 23 When he had slaughtered it, Moses took some of its blood and put it
on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
24 Moses had the sons of Aaron also come forward, and he put some of the blood on the tips of
their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. The rest
of the blood he splashed on the sides of the altar. 25 He then took the fat: the fatty tail and all the
fat over the inner organs, the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat, and likewise the
right leg; 26 from the basket of unleavened food that was set before the LORD he took one
unleavened cake, one loaf of bread made with oil, and one wafer; these he placed on top of the
portions of fat and the right leg. 27 He then put all these things into the hands of Aaron and his
sons, whom he had wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 28 When he had received
them back, Moses burned them with the holocaust on the altar as the ordination offering, a
sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 29 He then took the breast and waved it as a wave
offering before the LORD; this was Moses’ own portion of the ordination ram. All this was in
keeping with the LORD’S command to Moses. 30 Taking some of the anointing oil and some of
the blood that was on the altar, Moses sprinkled with it Aaron and his vestments, as well as his
sons and their vestments, thus consecrating both Aaron and his vestments and his sons and their
Books of Moses

96

vestments.
31 Finally, Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the meeting
tent, and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of the ordination offering, in keeping with
the command I have received: ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat of it.’ 32 What is left over of the
flesh and the bread you shall burn up in the fire. 33 Moreover, you are not to depart from the
entrance of the meeting tent for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed; for
your ordination is to last for seven days. 34 The LORD has commanded that what has been done
today be done to make atonement for you. 35 Hence you must remain at the entrance of the
meeting tent day and night for seven days, carrying out the prescriptions of the LORD;
otherwise, you shall die; for this is the command I have received.” 36 So Aaron and his sons did
all that the LORD had commanded through Moses.
Lev. 9
Octave of the Ordination. 1 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons,
together with the elders of Israel, 2 and said to Aaron, “Take a calf for a sin offering and a ram
for a holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. 3 Tell the elders of
Israel, too: Take a he-goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb, both unblemished yearlings, for a
holocaust, 4 and an ox and a ram for a peace offering, to sacrifice them before the LORD, along
with a cereal offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD will reveal himself to you.” 5 So they
brought what Moses had ordered. When the whole community had come forward and stood
before the LORD, 6 Moses said, “This is what the LORD orders you to do, that the glory of the
LORD may be revealed to you. 7 Come up to the altar,” Moses then told Aaron, “and offer your
sin offering and your holocaust in atonement for yourself and for your family; then present the
offering of the people in atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.”
8 Going up to the altar, Aaron first slaughtered the calf that was his own sin offering. 9
When his sons presented the blood to him, he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the
horns of the altar. The rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. 10 He then burned
on the altar the fat, the kidneys and the lobe of the liver that were taken from the sin offering, as
the LORD had commanded Moses; 11 but the flesh and the hide he burned up in the fire outside
the camp. 12 Then Aaron slaughtered his holocaust. When his sons brought him the blood, he
splashed it on all sides of the altar. 13 They then brought him the pieces and the head of the
holocaust, and he burned them on the altar. 14 Having washed the inner organs and the shanks,
he burned these also with the holocaust on the altar.
15 Thereupon he had the people’s offering brought up. Taking the goat that was for the
people’s sin offering, he slaughtered it and offered it up for sin as before. 16 Then he brought
forward the holocaust, other than the morning holocaust, and offered it in the usual manner. 17
He then presented the cereal offering; taking a handful of it, he burned it on the altar. 18 Finally
he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the peace offering of the people. When his sons brought him
the blood, Aaron splashed it on all sides of the altar. 19 The portions of fat from the ox and from
the ram, the fatty tail, the fatty membrane over the inner organs, the two kidneys, with the fat that
is on them, and the lobe of the liver, 20 he placed on top of the breasts and burned them on the
altar, 21 having first waved the breasts and the right legs as a wave offering before the LORD, in
keeping with the LORD’S command to Moses.
Revelation of the Lord’s Glory. 22 Aaron then raised his hands over the people and
blessed them. When he came down from offering the sin offering and holocaust and peace
offering, 23 Moses and Aaron went into the meeting tent. On coming out they again blessed the
people. Then the glory of the LORD was revealed to all the people. 24 Fire came forth from the
LORD’S presence and consumed the holocaust and the remnants of the fat on the altar. Seeing
this, all the people cried out and fell prostrate.

Lev. 10
Nadab and Abihu. 1 During this time Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers
and, strewing incense on the fire they had put in them, they offered up before the LORD profane
fire, such as he had not authorized. 2 Fire therefore came forth from the LORD’S presence and
consumed them, so that they died in his presence. 3 Moses then said to Aaron, “This is as the
LORD said: Through those who approach me I will manifest my sacredness; In the sight of all
the people I will reveal my glory.” But Aaron said nothing. 4 Then Moses summoned Mishael
and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, with the order, “Come, remove your kinsmen
from the sanctuary and carry them to a place outside the camp.” 5 So they went in and took
them, in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had commanded.
Conduct of the Priests. 6 Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not
bare your heads or tear your garments, lest you bring not only death on yourselves but God’s
wrath also on the whole community. Your kinsmen, the rest of the house of Israel, shall mourn
for those whom the LORD’S fire has smitten; 7 but do not you go beyond the entry of the
meeting tent, else you shall die; for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.” So they did as
Moses told them.
8 The LORD said to Aaron, 9 “When you are to go to the meeting tent, you and your sons
are forbidden under pain of death, by a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations, to drink
any wine or strong drink. 10 You must be able to distinguish between what is sacred and what is
profane, between what is clean and what is unclean; 11 you must teach the Israelites all the laws
that the LORD has given them through Moses.”
The Eating of the Priestly Portions. 12 Moses said to Aaron and his surviving sons,
Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the cereal offering left over from the oblations of the LORD, and eat
it beside the altar in the form of unleavened cakes. Since it is most sacred, 13 you must eat it in a
sacred place. This is your due from the oblations of the LORD, and that of your sons; such is the
command I have received. 14 With your sons and daughters you shall also eat the breast of the
wave offering and the leg of the raised offering, in a clean place; for these have been assigned to
you and your children as your due from the peace offerings of the Israelites. 15 The leg of the
raised offering and the breast of the wave offering shall first be brought in with the oblations, the
fatty portions, that are to be waved as a wave offering before the LORD. Then they shall belong
to you and your children by a perpetual ordinance, as the LORD has commanded.”
16 When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering, he discovered that it had all been
burned. So he was angry with the surviving sons of Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar, and said, 17
“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sacred place, since it is most sacred? It has been
given to you that you might bear the guilt of the community and make atonement for them before
the LORD. 18 If its blood was not brought into the inmost part of the sanctuary, you should
certainly have eaten the offering in the sanctuary, in keeping with the command I had received.”
19 Aaron answered Moses, “Even though they presented their sin offering and holocaust before
the LORD today, yet this misfortune has befallen me. Had I then eaten of the sin offering today,
would it have been pleasing to the LORD?” 20 On hearing this, Moses was satisfied.
III. LAWS REGUARDING LEGAL PURITY
Lev. 11
Clean and Unclean Food. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 2 “Speak to the
Israelites and tell them: Of all land animals these are the ones you may eat 3 any animal that has
hoofs you may eat, provided it is cloven-footed and chews the cud. 4 But you shall not eat any of
the following that only chew the cud or only have hoofs: the camel, which indeed chews the cud,
but does not have hoofs and is therefore unclean for you; 5 the rock badger, which indeed chews
the cud, but does not have hoofs and is therefore unclean for you; 6 the hare, which indeed chews
the cud, but does not have hoofs and is therefore unclean for you; and the pig, 7 which does
Books of Moses

98

indeed have hoofs and is cloven-footed, but does not chew the cud and is therefore unclean for
you. 8 Their flesh you shall not eat, and their dead bodies you shall not touch; they are unclean
for you.
9 “Of the various creatures that live in the water, you may eat the following: whatever in the
seas or in river waters has both fins and scales you may eat. 10 But of the various creatures that
crawl or swim in the water, whether in the sea or in the rivers, all those that lack either fins or
scales are loathsome for you, 11 and you shall treat them as loathsome. Their flesh you shall not
eat, and their dead bodies you shall loathe. 12 Every water creature that lacks fins or scales is
loathsome for you.
13 “Of the birds, these you shall loathe and, as loathsome, they shall not be eaten: the eagle,
the vulture, the osprey, 14 the kite, the various species of falcons, 15 the various species of
crows, 16 the ostrich, the nightjar, the gull, the various species of hawks, 17 the owl, the
cormorant, the screech owl, 18 the barn owl, the desert owl, the buzzard, 19 the stork, the various
species of herons, the hoopoe, and the bat.
20 “The various winged insects that walk on all fours are loathsome for you. 21 But of the
various winged insects that walk on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs for leaping
on the ground; 22 hence of these you may eat the following: the various kinds of locusts, the
various kinds of grasshoppers, the various kinds of katydids, and the various kinds of crickets. 23
All other winged insects that have four legs are loathsome for you.
24 “Such is the uncleanness that you contract, that everyone who touches their dead bodies
shall be unclean until evening, 25 and everyone who picks up any part of their dead bodies shall
wash his garments and be unclean until evening. 26 All hoofed animals that are not clovenfooted or do not chew the cud are unclean for you; everyone who touches them becomes
unclean. 27 Of the various quadrupeds, all those that walk on paws are unclean for you; everyone
who touches their dead bodies shall be unclean until evening, 28 and everyone who picks up
their dead bodies shall wash his garments and be unclean until evening. Such is their uncleanness
for you.
29 “Of the creatures that swarm on the ground, the following are unclean for you: the rat, the
mouse, the various kinds of lizards, 30 the gecko, the chameleon, the agama, the skink, and the
mole. 31 Among the various swarming creatures, these are unclean for you. Everyone who
touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening. 32 Everything on which one of
them falls when dead becomes unclean. Any such article that men use, whether it be an article of
wood, cloth, leather or goat hair, must be put in water and remain unclean until evening, when it
again becomes clean. 33 Should any of these creatures fall into a clay vessel, everything in it
becomes unclean, and the vessel itself you must break. 34 Any solid food that was in contact
with water, and any liquid that men drink, in any such vessel become unclean. 35 Any object on
which one of their dead bodies falls, becomes unclean; if it is an oven or a jar-stand, this must be
broken to pieces; they are unclean and shall be treated as unclean by you. 36 However, a spring
or a cistern for collecting water remains clean; but whoever touches the dead body becomes
unclean. 37 Any sort of cultivated grain remains clean even though one of their dead bodies falls
on it; 38 but if the grain has become moistened, it becomes unclean when one of these falls on it.
39 “When one of the animals that you could otherwise eat, dies of itself, anyone who
touches its dead body shall be unclean until evening; 40 and anyone who eats of its dead body
shall wash his garments and be unclean until evening; so also, anyone who removes its dead
body shall wash his garments and be unclean until evening.
41 “All the creatures that swarm on the ground are loathsome and shall not be eaten. 42
Whether it crawls on its belly, goes on all fours, or has many legs, you shall eat no swarming
creature: they are loathsome. 43 Do not make yourselves loathsome or unclean with any
swarming creature through being contaminated by them. 44 For I, the LORD, am your God; and
you shall make and keep yourselves holy, because I am holy. You shall not make yourselves
Books of Moses

99

unclean, then, by any swarming creature that crawls on the ground. 45 Since I, the LORD,
brought you up from the land of Egypt that I might be your God, you shall be holy, because I am
holy.
46 “This is the law for animals and birds and for all the creatures that move about in the
water or swarm on the ground, 47 that you may distinguish between the clean and the unclean,
between creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.”
Lev. 12
Uncleanness in Childbirth. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites: When a
woman has conceived and gives birth to a boy, she shall be unclean for seven days, with the
same uncleanness as at her menstrual period. 3 On the eighth day, the flesh of the boy’s foreskin
shall be circumcised, 4 and then she shall spend thirty-three days more in becoming purified of
her blood; she shall not touch anything sacred nor enter the sanctuary till the days of her
purification are fulfilled. 5 If she gives birth to a girl, for fourteen days she shall be as unclean as
at her menstruation, after which she shall spend sixty-six days in becoming purified of her blood.
6 “When the days of her purification for a son or for a daughter are fulfilled, she shall bring
to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent a yearling lamb for a holocaust and a pigeon or a
turtledove for a sin offering. 7 The priest shall offer them up before the LORD to make
atonement for her, and thus she will be clean again after her flow of blood. Such is the law for
the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl child. 8 If, however, she cannot afford a lamb, she
may take two turtledoves or two pigeons, the one for a holocaust and the other for a sin offering.
The priest shall make atonement for her, and thus she will again be clean.”
Lev. 13
Leprosy. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 2 “If someone has on his skin a scab or
pustule or blotch which appears to be the sore of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron, the priest,
or to one of the priests among his descendants, 3 who shall examine the sore on his skin. If the
hair on the sore has turned white and the sore itself shows that it has penetrated below the skin, it
is indeed the sore of leprosy; the priest, on seeing this, shall declare the man unclean. 4 If,
however, the blotch on the skin is white, but does not seem to have penetrated below the skin,
nor has the hair turned white, the priest shall quarantine the stricken man for seven days. 5 On
the seventh day the priest shall again examine him. If he judges that the sore has remained
unchanged and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall quarantine him for another seven days,
6 and once more examine him on the seventh day. If the sore is now dying out and has not spread
on the skin, the priest shall declare the man clean; it was merely eczema. The man shall wash his
garments and so become clean. 7 But if, after he has shown himself to the priest to be declared
clean, the eczema spreads at all on his skin, he shall once more show himself to the priest. 8
Should the priest, on examining it, find that the eczema has indeed spread on the skin, he shall
declare the man unclean; it is leprosy.
9 “When someone is stricken with leprosy, he shall be brought to the priest. 10 Should the
priest, on examining him, find that there is a white scab on the skin which has turned the hair
white and that there is raw flesh in it, 11 it is skin leprosy that has long developed. The priest
shall declare the man unclean without first quarantining him, since he is certainly unclean. 12 If
leprosy breaks out on the skin and, as far as the priest can see, covers all the skin of the stricken
man from head to foot, 13 should the priest then, on examining him, find that the leprosy does
cover his whole body, he shall declare the stricken man clean; since it has all turned white, the
man is clean. 14 But as soon as raw flesh appears on him, he is unclean; 15 on observing the raw
flesh, the priest shall declare him unclean, because raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy. 16 If,
however, the raw flesh again turns white, he shall return to the priest; 17 should the latter, on
examining him, find that the sore has indeed turned white, he shall declare the stricken man
Books of Moses

100

clean, and thus he will be clean.
18 “If a man who had a boil on his skin which later healed, 19 should now in the place of the
boil have a white scab or a pink blotch, he shall show himself to the priest. 20 If the latter, on
examination, sees that it is deeper than the skin and that the hair has turned white, he shall
declare the man unclean; it is the sore of leprosy that has broken out in the boil. 21 But if the
priest, on examining him, finds that there is no white hair in it and that it is not deeper than the
skin and is already dying out, the priest shall quarantine him for seven days. 22 If it has then
spread on the skin, the priest shall declare him unclean; the man is stricken. 23 But if the blotch
remains in its place without spreading, it is merely the scar of the boil; the priest shall therefore
declare him clean.
24 “If a man had a burn on his skin, and the proud flesh of the burn now becomes a pink or a
white blotch, 25 the priest shall examine it. If the hair has turned white on the blotch and this
seems to have penetrated below the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn; the priest
shall therefore declare him unclean and stricken with leprosy. 26 But if the priest, on examining
it, finds that there is no white hair on the blotch and that this is not deeper than the skin and is
already dying out, the priest shall quarantine him for seven days. 27 Should the priest, when
examining it on the seventh day, find that it has spread at all on the skin, he shall declare the man
unclean and stricken with leprosy. 28 But if the blotch remains in its place without spreading on
the skin and is already dying out, it is merely the scab of the burn; the priest shall therefore
declare the man clean, since it is only the scar of the burn.
29 “When a man or a woman has a sore on the head or cheek, 30 should the priest, on
examining it, find that the sore has penetrated below the skin and that there is fine yellow hair on
it, the priest shall declare the person unclean, for this is scall, a leprous disease of the head or
cheek. 31 But if the priest, on examining the scall sore, finds that it has not penetrated below the
skin, though the hair on it may not be black, the priest shall quarantine the person with scall sore
for seven days, 32 and on the seventh day again examine the sore. If the scall has not spread and
has no yellow hair on it and does not seem to have penetrated below the skin, 33 the man shall
shave himself, but not on the diseased spot. Then the priest shall quarantine him for another
seven days. 34 If the priest, when examining the scall on the seventh day, finds that it has not
spread on the skin and that it has not penetrated below the skin, he shall declare the man clean;
the latter shall wash his garments, and thus he will be clean. 35 But if the scall spreads at all on
his skin after he has been declared clean, 36 the priest shall again examine it. If the scall has
indeed spread on the skin, he need not look for yellow hair; the man is surely unclean. 37 If,
however, he judges that the scall has remained in its place and that black hair has grown on it,
the disease has been healed; the man is clean, and the priest shall declare him clean.
38 “When the skin of a man or a woman is spotted with white blotches, 39 the priest shall
make an examination. If the blotches on the skin are white and already dying out, it is only tetter
that has broken out on the skin, and the person therefore is clean.
40 “When a man loses the hair of his head, he is not unclean merely because of his bald
crown. 41 So too, if he loses the hair on the front of his head, he is not unclean merely because of
his bald forehead. 42 But when there is a pink sore on his bald crown or bald forehead, it is
leprosy that is breaking out there. 43 The priest shall examine him; and if the scab on the sore of
the bald spot has the same pink appearance as that of skin leprosy of the fleshy part of the body,
44 the man is leprous and unclean, and the priest shall declare him unclean by reason of the sore
on his head.
45 “The one who bears the sore of leprosy shall keep his garments rent and his head bare,
and shall muffle his beard; he shall cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’ 46 As long as the sore is on him
he shall declare himself unclean, since he is in fact unclean. He shall dwell apart, making his
abode outside the camp.
Leprosy of Clothes. 47 “When a leprous infection is on a garment of wool or of linen, 48
Books of Moses

101

or on woven or knitted material of linen or wool, or on a hide or anything made of leather, 49 if
the infection on the garment or hide, or on the woven or knitted material, or on any leather article
is greenish or reddish, the thing is indeed infected with leprosy and must be shown to the priest.
50 Having examined the infection, the priest shall quarantine the infected article for seven days.
51 “On the seventh day the priest shall again examine the infection. If it has spread on the
garment, or on the woven or knitted material, or on the leather, whatever be its use, the infection
is malignant leprosy, and the article is unclean. 52 He shall therefore burn up the garment, or the
woven or knitted material of wool or linen, or the leather article, whatever it may be, which is
infected; since it has malignant leprosy, it must be destroyed by fire. 53 But if the priest, on
examining the infection, finds that it has not spread on the garment, or on the woven or knitted
material, or on the leather article, 54 he shall give orders to have the infected article washed and
then quarantined for another seven days.
55 “Then the priest shall again examine the infected article after it has been washed. If the
infection has not changed its appearance, even though it may not have spread, the article is
unclean and shall be destroyed by fire. 56 But if the priest, on examining the infection, finds that
it is dying out after the washing, he shall tear the infected part out of the garment, or the leather,
or the woven or knitted material. 57 If, however, the infection again appears on the garment, or
on the woven or knitted material, or on the leather article, it is still virulent and the thing infected
shall be destroyed by fire. 58 But if, after the washing, the infection has left the garment, or the
woven or knitted material, or the leather article, the thing shall be washed a second time, and
thus it will be clean. 59 This is the law for leprous infection on a garment of wool or linen, or on
woven or knitted material, or on any leather article, to determine whether it is clean or unclean.”
Lev. 14
Purification After Leprosy. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “This is the law for the victim
of leprosy at the time of his purification. He shall be brought to the priest, 3 who is to go outside
the camp to examine him. If the priest finds that the sore of leprosy has healed in the leper, 4 he
shall order the man who is to be purified, to get two live, clean birds, as well as some cedar
wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop. 5 The priest shall then order him to slay one of the birds over an
earthen vessel with spring water in it. 6 Taking the living bird with the cedar wood, the scarlet
yarn and the hyssop, the priest shall dip them all in the blood of the bird that was slain over the
spring water, 7 and then sprinkle seven times the man to be purified from his leprosy. When he
has thus purified him, he shall let the living bird fly away over the countryside. 8 The man being
purified shall then wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water; only when he
is thus made clean may he come inside the camp; but he shall still remain outside his tent for
seven days. 9 On the seventh day he shall again shave off all the hair of his head, his beard, his
eyebrows, and any other hair he may have, and also wash his garments and bathe his body in
water; and so he will be clean.
Purification Sacrifices. 10 “On the eighth day he shall take two unblemished male lambs,
one unblemished yearling ewe lamb, three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a
cereal offering, and one log of oil. 11 The priest who performs the purification ceremony shall
place the man who is being purified, as well as all these offerings, before the LORD at the
entrance of the meeting tent. 12 Taking one of the male lambs, the priest shall present it as a guilt
offering, along with the log of oil, waving them as a wave offering before the LORD. 13 (This
lamb he shall slaughter in the sacred place where the sin offering and the holocaust are
slaughtered; because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest and is most
sacred.) 14 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the tip
of the man’s right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot. 15 The priest
shall also take the log of oil and pour some of it into the palm of his own left hand; 16 then,
dipping his right forefinger in it, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the LORD. 17 Of the oil
Books of Moses

102

left in his hand the priest shall put some on the tip of the man’s right ear, the thumb of his right
hand, and the big toe of his right foot, over the blood of the guilt offering. 18 The rest of the oil
in his hand the priest shall put on the head of the man being purified. Thus shall the priest make
atonement for him before the LORD. 19 Only after he has offered the sin offering in atonement
for the man’s uncleanness shall the priest slaughter the holocaust 20 and offer it, together with
the cereal offering, on the altar before the LORD. When the priest has thus made atonement for
him, the man will be clean.
Poor Leper’s Sacrifice. 21 “If a man is poor and cannot afford so much, he shall take one
male lamb for a guilt offering, to be used as a wave offering in atonement for himself, one tenth
of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering, a log of oil, 22 and two turtledoves
or pigeons, which he can more easily afford, the one as a sin offering and the other as a
holocaust. 23 On the eighth day of his purification he shall bring them to the priest, at the
entrance of the meeting tent before the LORD. 24 Taking the guilt-offering lamb, along with the
log of oil, the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 25 When he has
slaughtered the guilt-offering lamb, he shall take some of its blood, and put it on the tip of the
right ear of the man being purified, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right
foot. 26 The priest shall then pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand 27 and with
his right forefinger sprinkle it seven times before the LORD. 28 Some of the oil in his hand the
priest shall also put on the tip of the man’s right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe
of his right foot, over the blood of the guilt offering. 29 The rest of the oil in his hand the priest
shall put on the man’s head. Thus shall he make atonement for him before the LORD. 30 Then,
of the turtledoves or pigeons, such as the man can afford, 31 the priest shall offer up one as a sin
offering and the other as a holocaust, along with the cereal offering. Thus shall the priest make
atonement before the LORD for the man who is to be purified. 32 This is the law for one
afflicted with leprosy who has insufficient means for his purification.”
Leprosy of Houses. 33 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 34 “When you come into the
land of Canaan, which I am giving you to possess, if I put a leprous infection on any house of the
land you occupy, 35 the owner of the house shall come and report to the priest, ‘It looks to me as
if my house were infected.’ 36 The priest shall then order the house to be cleared out before he
goes in to examine the infection, lest everything in the house become unclean. Only after this is
he to go in to examine the house. 37 If the priest, on examining it, finds that the infection on the
walls of the house consists of greenish or reddish depressions which seem to go deeper than the
surface of the wall, 38 he shall close the door of the house behind him and quarantine the house
for seven days. 39 On the seventh day the priest shall return to examine the house again. If he
finds that the infection has spread on the walls, 40 he shall order the infected stones to be pulled
out and cast in an unclean place outside the city. 41 The whole inside of the house shall then be
scraped, and the mortar that has been scraped off shall be dumped in an unclean place outside the
city. 42 Then new stones shall be brought and put in the place of the old stones, and new mortar
shall be made and plastered on the house.
43 “If the infection breaks out once more after the stones have been pulled out and the house
has been scraped and replastered, 44 the priest shall come again; and if he finds that the infection
has spread in the house, it is corrosive leprosy, and the house is unclean. 45 It shall be pulled
down, and all its stones, beams and mortar shall be hauled away to an unclean place outside the
city. 46 Whoever enters a house while it is quarantined shall be unclean until evening. 47
Whoever sleeps or eats in such a house shall also wash his garments. 48 If the priest finds, when
he comes to examine the house, that the infection has in fact not spread after the plastering, he
shall declare the house clean, since the infection has been healed. 49 To purify the house, he
shall take two birds, as well as cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop. 50 One of the birds he shall
slay over an earthen vessel with spring water in it. 51 Then, taking the cedar wood, the hyssop
and the scarlet yarn, together with the living bird, he shall dip them all in the blood of the slain
Books of Moses

103

bird and the spring water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 52 Thus shall he purify the house
with the bird’s blood and the spring water, along with the living bird, the cedar wood, the
hyssop, and the scarlet yarn. 53 He shall then let the living bird fly away over the countryside
outside the city. When he has thus made atonement for it, the house will be clean.
54 “This is the law for every kind of human leprosy and scall, 55 for leprosy of garments
and houses, 56 as well as for scabs, pustules and blotches, 57 so that it may be manifest when
there is a state of uncleanness and when a state of cleanness. This is the law for leprosy.”
Lev. 15
Personal Uncleanness. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 2 “Speak to the Israelites
and tell them: Every man who is afflicted with a chronic flow from his private parts is thereby
unclean. 3 Such is his uncleanness from this flow that it makes no difference whether the flow
drains off or is blocked up; his uncleanness remains. 4 Any bed on which the man afflicted with
the flow lies, is unclean, and any piece of furniture on which he sits, is unclean. 5 Anyone who
touches his bed shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 6
Whoever sits on a piece of furniture on which the afflicted man was sitting, shall wash his
garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 7 Whoever touches the body of the
afflicted man shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 8 If the
afflicted man spits on a clean man, the latter shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be
unclean until evening. 9 Any saddle on which the afflicted man rides, is unclean. 10 Whoever
touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until evening; whoever lifts up any such
thing shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 11 Anyone whom
the afflicted man touches with unrinsed hands shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be
unclean until evening. 12 Earthenware touched by the afflicted man shall be broken; and every
wooden article shall be rinsed with water.
13 “When a man who has been afflicted with a flow becomes free of his affliction, he shall
wait seven days for his purification. Then he shall wash his garments and bathe his body in fresh
water, and so he will be clean. 14 On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons,
and going before the LORD, to the entrance of the meeting tent, he shall give them to the priest,
15 who shall offer them up, the one as a sin offering and the other as a holocaust. Thus shall the
priest make atonement before the LORD for the man’s flow.
16 “When a man has an emission of seed, he shall bathe his whole body in water and be
unclean until evening. 17 Any piece of cloth or leather with seed on it shall be washed with
water and be unclean until evening.
18 “If a man lies carnally with a woman, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until
evening.
19 “When a woman has her menstrual flow, she shall be in a state of impurity for seven
days. Anyone who touches her shall be unclean until evening. 20 Anything on which she lies or
sits during her impurity shall be unclean. 21 Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his
garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 22 Whoever touches any article of
furniture on which she was sitting, shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until
evening. 23 But if she is on the bed or on the seat when he touches it, he shall be unclean until
evening. 24 If a man dares to lie with her, he contracts her impurity and shall be unclean for
seven days; every bed on which he then lies also becomes unclean.
25 “When a woman is afflicted with a flow of blood for several days outside her menstrual
period, or when her flow continues beyond the ordinary period, as long as she suffers this
unclean flow she shall be unclean, just as during her menstrual period. 26 Any bed on which she
lies during such a flow becomes unclean, as it would during her menstruation, and any article of
furniture on which she sits becomes unclean just as during her menstruation. 27 Anyone who
touches them becomes unclean; he shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until

evening.
28 “If she becomes freed from her affliction, she shall wait seven days, and only then is she
to be purified. 29 On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them
to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent. 30 The priest shall offer up one of them as a sin
offering and the other as a holocaust. Thus shall the priest make atonement before the LORD for
her unclean flow.
31 “You shall warn the Israelites of their uncleanness, lest by defiling my Dwelling, which
is in their midst, their uncleanness be the cause of their death.
32 “This is the law for the man who is afflicted with a chronic flow, or who has an emission
of seed, and thereby becomes unclean; 33 as well as for the woman who has her menstrual
period, or who is afflicted with a chronic flow; the law for male and female; and also for the man
who lies with an unclean woman.”
Lev. 16
The Day of Atonement. 1 After the death of Aaron’s two sons, who died when they
approached the LORD’S presence, the LORD spoke to Moses 2 and said to him, “Tell your
brother Aaron that he is not to come whenever he pleases into the sanctuary, inside the veil, in
front of the propitiatory on the ark; otherwise, when I reveal myself in a cloud above the
propitiatory, he will die. 3 Only in this way may Aaron enter the sanctuary. He shall bring a
young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a holocaust. 4 He shall wear the sacred linen tunic,
with the linen drawers next his flesh, gird himself with the linen sash and put on the linen miter.
But since these vestments are sacred, he shall not put them on until he has first bathed his body
in water. 5 From the Israelite community he shall receive two male goats for a sin offering and
one ram for a holocaust.
6 “Aaron shall bring in the bullock, his sin offering to atone for himself and for his
household. 7 Taking the two male goats and setting them before the LORD at the entrance of the
meeting tent, 8 he shall cast lots to determine which one is for the LORD and which for Azazel.
9 The goat that is determined by lot for the LORD, Aaron shall bring in and offer up as a sin
offering. 10 But the goat determined by lot for Azazel he shall set alive before the LORD, so that
with it he may make atonement by sending it off to Azazel in the desert.
11 “Thus shall Aaron offer up the bullock, his sin offering, to atone for himself and for his
family. When he has slaughtered it, 12 he shall take a censer full of glowing embers from the
altar before the LORD, as well as a double handful of finely ground fragrant incense, and
bringing them inside the veil, 13 there before the LORD he shall put incense on the fire, so that a
cloud of incense may cover the propitiatory over the commandments; else he will die. 14 Taking
some of the bullock’s blood, he shall sprinkle it with his finger on the fore part of the
propitiatory and likewise sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times in front of the
propitiatory.
15 “Then he shall slaughter the people’s sin-offering goat, and bringing its blood inside the
veil, he shall do with it as he did with the bullock’s blood, sprinkling it on the propitiatory and
before it. 16 Thus he shall make atonement for the sanctuary because of all the sinful defilements
and faults of the Israelites. He shall do the same for the meeting tent, which is set up among them
in the midst of their uncleanness. 17 No one else may be in the meeting tent from the time he
enters the sanctuary to make atonement until he departs. When he has made atonement for
himself and his household, as well as for the whole Israelite community, 18 he shall come out to
the altar before the LORD and make atonement for it also. Taking some of the bullock’s and the
goat’s blood, he shall put it on the horns around the altar, 19 and with his finger sprinkle some of
the blood on it seven times. Thus he shall render it clean and holy, purged of the defilements of
the Israelites.
The Sacpegoat. 20 “When he has completed the atonement rite for the sanctuary, the
Books of Moses

105

meeting tent and the altar, Aaron shall bring forward the live goat. 21 Laying both hands on its
head, he shall confess over it all the sinful faults and transgressions of the Israelites, and so put
them on the goat’s head. He shall then have it led into the desert by an attendant. 22 Since the
goat is to carry off their iniquities to an isolated region, it must be sent away into the desert.
23 “After Aaron has again gone into the meeting tent, he shall strip off and leave in the
sanctuary the linen vestments he had put on when he entered there. 24 After bathing his body
with water in a sacred place, he shall put on his vestments, and then come out and offer his own
and the people’s holocaust, in atonement for himself and for the people, 25 and also burn the fat
of the sin offering on the altar.
26 “The man who has led away the goat for Azazel shall wash his garments and bathe his
body in water; only then may he enter the camp. 27 The sin-offering bullock and goat whose
blood was brought into the sanctuary to make atonement, shall be taken outside the camp, where
their hides and flesh and offal shall be burned up in the fire. 28 The one who burns them shall
wash his garments and bathe his body in water; only then may he enter the camp.
The Fast. 29 “This shall be an everlasting ordinance for you: on the tenth day of the
seventh month every one of you, whether a native or a resident alien, shall mortify himself and
shall do no work. 30 Since on this day atonement is made for you to make you clean, so that you
may be cleansed of all your sins before the LORD, 31 by everlasting ordinance it shall be a most
solemn sabbath for you, on which you must mortify yourselves.
32 “This atonement is to be made by the priest who has been anointed and ordained to the
priesthood in succession to his father. He shall wear the linen garments, the sacred vestments, 33
and make atonement for the sacred sanctuary, the meeting tent and the altar, as well as for the
priests and all the people of the community. 34 This, then, shall be an everlasting ordinance for
you: once a year atonement shall be made for all the sins of the Israelites.”
Thus was it done, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
IV. CODE OF LEGAL HOLINESS
Lev. 17
Sacredness of Blood. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, as well
as to all the Israelites, and tell them: This is what the LORD has commanded. 3 Any Israelite
who slaughters an ox or a sheep or a goat, whether in the camp or outside of it, 4 without first
bringing it to the entrance of the meeting tent to present it as an offering to the LORD in front of
his Dwelling, shall be judged guilty of bloodshed; and for this, such a man shall be cut off from
among his people. 5 Therefore, such sacrifices as they used to offer up in the open field the
Israelites shall henceforth offer to the LORD, bringing them to the priest at the entrance of the
meeting tent and sacrificing them there as peace offerings to the LORD. 6 The priest shall splash
the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance of the meeting tent and there burn the fat for
an odor pleasing to the LORD. 7 No longer shall they offer their sacrifices to the satyrs to whom
they used to render their wanton worship. This shall be an everlasting ordinance for them and
their descendants.
8 “Tell them, therefore: Anyone, whether of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing
among them, who offers a holocaust or sacrifice 9 without bringing it to the entrance of the
meeting tent to offer it to the LORD, shall be cut off from his kinsmen. 10 And if anyone,
whether of the house of Israel or of the aliens residing among them, partakes of any blood, I will
set myself against that one who partakes of blood and will cut him off from among his people. 11
Since the life of a living body is in its blood, I have made you put it on the altar, so that
atonement may thereby be made for your own lives, because it is the blood, as the seat of life,
that makes atonement. 12 That is why I have told the Israelites: No one among you, not even a
resident alien, may partake of blood.
13 “Anyone hunting, whether of the Israelites or of the aliens residing among them, who
Books of Moses

106

catches an animal or a bird that may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth. 14
Since the life of every living body is its blood, I have told the Israelites: You shall not partake of
the blood of any meat. Since the life of every living body is its blood, anyone who partakes of it
shall be cut off.
15 “Everyone, whether a native or an alien, who eats of an animal that died of itself or was
killed by a wild beast, shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening, and
then he will be clean. 16 If he does not wash or does not bathe his body, he shall have the guilt to
bear.”
Lev. 18
The Sanctity of Sex. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I,
the LORD, am your God. 3 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you once
lived, nor shall you do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you; do not
conform to their customs. 4 My decrees you shall carry out, and my statutes you shall take care
to follow. I, the LORD, am your God. 5 Keep, then, my statutes and decrees, for the man who
carries them out will find life through them. I am the LORD.
6 “None of you shall approach a close relative to have sexual intercourse with her. I am the
LORD. 7 You shall not disgrace your father by having intercourse with your mother. Besides,
since she is your own mother, you shall not have intercourse with her. 8 You shall not have
intercourse with your father’s wife, for that would be a disgrace to your father. 9 You shall not
have intercourse with your sister, your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she
was born in your own household or born elsewhere. 10 You shall not have intercourse with your
son’s daughter or with your daughter’s daughter, for that would be a disgrace to your own
family. 11 You shall not have intercourse with the daughter whom your father’s wife bore to
him, since she, too, is your sister. 12 You shall not have intercourse with your father’s sister,
since she is your father’s relative. 13 You shall not have intercourse with your mother’s sister,
since she is your mother’s relative. 14 You shall not disgrace your father’s brother by being
intimate with his wife, since she, too, is your aunt. 15 You shall not have intercourse with your
daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, and therefore you shall not disgrace her. 16 You shall
not have intercourse with your brother’s wife, for that would be a disgrace to your brother. 17
You shall not have intercourse with a woman and also with her daughter, nor shall you marry
and have intercourse with her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter; this would be shameful,
because they are related to her. 18 While your wife is still living you shall not marry her sister as
her rival; for thus you would disgrace your first wife.
19 “You shall not approach a woman to have intercourse with her while she is unclean from
menstruation. 20 You shall not have carnal relations with your neighbor’s wife, defiling yourself
with her. 21 You shall not offer any of your offspring to be immolated to Molech, thus profaning
the name of your God. I am the LORD. 22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; such a
thing is an abomination. 23 You shall not have carnal relations with an animal, defiling yourself
with it; nor shall a woman set herself in front of an animal to mate with it; such things are
abhorrent.
24 “Do not defile yourselves by any of these things by which the nations whom I am driving
out of your way have defiled themselves. 25 Because their land has become defiled, I am
punishing it for its wickedness, by making it vomit out its inhabitants. 26 You, however, whether
natives or resident aliens, must keep my statutes and decrees forbidding all such abominations 27
by which the previous inhabitants defiled the land; 28 otherwise the land will vomit you out also
for having defiled it, just as it vomited out the nations before you. 29 Everyone who does any of
these abominations shall be cut off from among his people. 30 Heed my charge, then, not to
defile yourselves by observing the abominable customs that have been observed before you. I,
the LORD, am your God.”
Books of Moses

107

Lev. 19
Various Rules of Conduct. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the whole Israelite
community and tell them: Be holy, for I, the LORD your God, am holy. 3 Revere your mother
and father, and keep my sabbaths. I, the LORD, am your God.
4 “Do not turn aside to idols, nor make molten gods for yourselves. I, the LORD, am your
God.
5 “When you sacrifice your peace offering to the LORD, if you wish it to be acceptable, 6 it
must be eaten on the very day of your sacrifice or on the following day. Whatever is left over
until the third day shall be burned up in the fire. 7 If any of it is eaten on the third day, the
sacrifice will be unacceptable as refuse; 8 whoever eats of it then shall pay the penalty for having
profaned what is sacred to the LORD. Such a one shall be cut off from his people.
9 “When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not be so thorough that you reap the
field to its very edge, nor shall you glean the stray ears of grain. 10 Likewise, you shall not pick
your vineyard bare, nor gather up the grapes that have fallen. These things you shall leave for the
poor and the alien. I, the LORD, am your God.
11 “You shall not steal. You shall not lie or speak falsely to one another. 12 You shall not
swear falsely by my name, thus profaning the name of your God. I am the LORD.
13 “You shall not defraud or rob your neighbor. You shall not withhold overnight the wages
of your day laborer. 14 You shall not curse the deaf, or put a stumbling block in front of the
blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the LORD.
15 “You shall not act dishonestly in rendering judgment. Show neither partiality to the weak
nor deference to the mighty, but judge your fellow men justly. 16 You shall not go about
spreading slander among your kinsmen; nor shall you stand by idly when your neighbor’s life is
at stake. I am the LORD.
17 “You shall not bear hatred for your brother in your heart. Though you may have to
reprove your fellow man, do not incur sin because of him. 18 Take no revenge and cherish no
grudge against your fellow countrymen. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the
LORD.
19 “Keep my statutes: do not breed any of your domestic animals with others of a different
species; do not sow a field of yours with two different kinds of seed; and do not put on a garment
woven with two different kinds of thread.
20 “If a man has carnal relations with a female slave who has already been living with
another man but has not yet been redeemed or given her freedom, they shall be punished but not
put to death, because she is not free. 21 The man, moreover, shall bring to the entrance of the
meeting tent a ram as his guilt offering to the LORD. 22 With this ram the priest shall make
atonement before the LORD for the sin he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.
23 “When you come into the land and plant any fruit tree there, first look upon its fruit as if
it were uncircumcised. For three years, while its fruit remains uncircumcised, it may not be
eaten. 24 In the fourth year, however, all of its fruit shall be sacred to the LORD as a
thanksgiving feast to him. 25 Not until the fifth year may you eat its fruit. Thus it will continue
its yield for you. I, the LORD, am your God.
26 “Do not eat meat with the blood still in it. Do not practice divination or soothsaying. 27
Do not clip your hair at the temples, nor trim the edges of your beard. 28 Do not lacerate your
bodies for the dead, and do not tattoo yourselves. I am the LORD.
29 “You shall not degrade your daughter by making a prostitute of her; else the land will
become corrupt and full of lewdness.
30 Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am the LORD.
31 “Do not go to mediums or consult fortune-tellers, for you will be defiled by them. I, the
LORD, am your God.
32 “Stand up in the presence of the aged, and show respect for the old; thus shall you fear
Books of Moses

108

your God. I am the LORD.
33 “When an alien resides with you in your land, do not molest him. 34 You shall treat the
alien who resides with you no differently than the natives born among you; have the same love
for him as for yourself; for you too were once aliens in the land of Egypt. I, the LORD, am your
God.
35 “Do not act dishonestly in using measures of length or weight or capacity. 36 You shall
have a true scale and true weights, an honest ephah and an honest hin. I, the LORD, am your
God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 37 Be careful, then, to observe all my statutes
and decrees. I am the LORD.”
Lev. 20
Penalties for Various Sins. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites: Anyone,
whether an Israelite or an alien residing in Israel, who gives any of his offspring to Molech shall
be put to death. Let his fellow citizens stone him. 3 I myself will turn against such a man and cut
him off from the body of his people; for in giving his offspring to Molech, he has defiled my
sanctuary and profaned my holy name. 4 Even if his fellow citizens connive at such a man’s
crime of giving his offspring to Molech, and fail to put him to death, 5 I myself will set my face
against that man and his family and will cut off from their people both him and all who join him
in his wanton worship of Molech. 6 Should anyone turn to mediums and fortune-tellers and
follow their wanton ways, I will turn against such a one and cut him off from his people. 7
Sanctify yourselves, then, and be holy; for I, the LORD, your God, am holy. 8 Be careful,
therefore, to observe what I, the LORD, who make you holy, have prescribed.
9 “Anyone who curses his father or mother shall be put to death; since he has cursed his
father or mother, he has forfeited his life. 10 If a man commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife,
both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death. 11 If a man disgraces his father by
lying with his father’s wife, both the man and his stepmother shall be put to death; they have
forfeited their lives. 12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death;
since they have committed an abhorrent deed, they have forfeited their lives. 13 If a man lies
with a male as with a woman, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they
have forfeited their lives. 14 If a man marries a woman and her mother also, the man and the two
women as well shall be burned to death for their shameful conduct, so that such shamefulness
may not be found among you. 15 If a man has carnal relations with an animal, the man shall be
put to death, and the animal shall be slain. 16 If a woman goes up to any animal to mate with it,
the woman and the animal shall be slain; let them both be put to death; their lives are forfeit. 17
If a man consummates marriage with his sister or his half-sister, they shall be publicly cut off
from their people for this shameful deed; the man shall pay the penalty of having had intercourse
with his own sister. 18 If a man lies in sexual intercourse with a woman during her menstrual
period, both of them shall be cut off from their people, because they have laid bare the flowing
fountain of her blood. 19 You shall not have intercourse with your mother’s sister or your
father’s sister; whoever does so shall pay the penalty of incest. 20 If a man disgraces his uncle by
having intercourse with his uncle’s wife, the man and his aunt shall pay the penalty by dying
childless. 21 If a man marries his brother’s wife and thus disgraces his brother, they shall be
childless because of this incest.
22 “Be careful to observe all my statutes and all my decrees; otherwise the land where I am
bringing you to dwell will vomit you out. 23 Do not conform, therefore, to the customs of the
nations whom I am driving out of your way, because all these things that they have done have
filled me with disgust for them. 24 But to you I have said: Their land shall be your possession, a
land flowing with milk and honey. I am giving it to you as your own, I, the LORD, your God,
who have set you apart from the other nations. 25 You, too, must set apart, then, the clean
animals from the unclean, and the clean birds from the unclean, so that you may not be
Books of Moses

109

contaminated with the uncleanness of any beast or bird or of any swarming creature in the land
that I have set apart for you. 26 To me, therefore, you shall be sacred; for I, the LORD, am
sacred, I, who have set you apart from the other nations to be my own.
27 “A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortune-teller shall be put to death by
stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.”
Lev. 21
Sanctity of the Priesthood. 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron’s sons, the
priests, and tell them: None of you shall make himself unclean for any dead person among his
people, 2 except for his nearest relatives, his mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother 3
or his maiden sister, who is of his own family while she remains unmarried; for these he may
make himself unclean. 4 But for a sister who has married out of his family he shall not make
himself unclean; this would be a profanation.
5 “The priests shall not make bare the crown of the head, nor shave the edges of the beard,
nor lacerate the body. 6 To their God they shall be sacred, and not profane his name; since they
offer up the oblations of the LORD, the food of their God, they must be holy.
7 “A priest shall not marry a woman who has been a prostitute or has lost her honor, nor a
woman who has been divorced by her husband; for the priest is sacred to his God. 8 Honor him
as sacred who offers up the food of your God; treat him as sacred, because I, the LORD, who
have consecrated him, am sacred.
9 “A priest’s daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors
her father also, shall be burned to death.
10 “The most exalted of the priests, upon whose head the anointing oil has been poured and
who has been ordained to wear the special vestments, shall not bare his head or rend his
garments, 11 nor shall he go near any dead person. Not even for his father or mother may he thus
become unclean 12 or leave the sanctuary; otherwise he will profane the sanctuary of his God,
for with the anointing oil upon him, he is dedicated to his God, to me, the LORD.
13 “The priest shall marry a virgin. 14 Not a widow or a woman who has been divorced or a
woman who has lost her honor as a prostitute, but a virgin, taken from his own people, shall he
marry; 15 otherwise he will have base offspring among his people. I, the LORD, have made him
sacred.”
Irregulations. 16 The LORD said to Moses, 17 “Speak to Aaron and tell him: None of your
descendants, of whatever generation, who has any defect shall come forward to offer up the food
of his God. 18 Therefore, he who has any of the following defects may not come forward: he
who is blind, or lame, or who has any disfigurement or malformation, 19 or a crippled foot or
hand, 20 or who is hump-backed or weakly or walleyed, or who is afflicted with eczema,
ringworm or hernia. 21 No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any such defect may draw
near to offer up the oblations of the LORD; on account of his defect he may not draw near to
offer up the food of his God. 22 He may, however, partake of the food of his God: of what is
most sacred as well as of what is sacred. 23 Only, he may not approach the veil nor go up to the
altar on account of his defect; he shall not profane these things that are sacred to me, for it is I,
the LORD, who make them sacred.”
24 Moses, therefore, told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
Lev. 22
Sacrificial Banquets. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell Aaron and his sons to respect the
sacred offerings which the Israelites consecrate to me; else they will profane my holy name. I am
the LORD.
3 “Tell them: If any one of you, or of your descendants in any future generation, dares,
while he is in a state of uncleanness, to draw near the sacred offerings which the Israelites
Books of Moses

110

consecrate to the LORD, such a one shall be cut off from my presence. I am the LORD.
4 “No descendant of Aaron who is stricken with leprosy, or who suffers from a flow, may
eat of these sacred offerings, unless he again becomes clean. Moreover, if anyone touches a
person who has become unclean by contact with a corpse, or if anyone has had an emission of
seed, 5 or if anyone touches any swarming creature or any man whose uncleanness, of whatever
kind it may be, is contagious, 6 the one who touches such as these shall be unclean until evening
and may not eat of the sacred portions until he has first bathed his body in water, 7 then, when
the sun sets, he again becomes clean. Only then may he eat of the sacred offerings, which are his
food. 8 He shall not make himself unclean by eating of any animal that has died of itself or has
been killed by wild beasts. I am the LORD.
9 “They shall keep my charge and not do wrong in this matter; else they will die for their
profanation. I am the LORD who have consecrated them.
10 “Neither a lay person nor a priest’s tenant or hired servant may eat of any sacred offering.
11 But a slave whom a priest acquires by purchase or who is born in his house may eat of his
food. 12 A priest’s daughter who is married to a layman may not eat of the sacred contributions.
13 But if a priest’s daughter is widowed or divorced and, having no children, returns to her
father’s house, she may then eat of her father’s food as in her youth. No layman, however, may
eat of it. 14 If such a one eats of a sacred offering through inadvertence, he shall make restitution
to the priest for the sacred offering, with an increment of one fifth of the amount. 15 The sacred
offerings which the Israelites contribute to the LORD the priests shall not allow to be profaned
16 nor in the eating of the sacred offering shall they bring down guilt that must be punished; it is
I, the LORD, who make them sacred.”
Unacceptable Victims. 17 The LORD said to Moses, 18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and
to all the Israelites, and tell them: When anyone of the house of Israel, or any alien residing in
Israel, who wishes to offer a sacrifice, brings a holocaust as a votive offering or as a free-will
offering to the LORD, 19 if it is to be acceptable, the ox or sheep or goat that he offers must be
an unblemished male. 20 You shall not offer one that has any defect, for such a one would not be
acceptable for you. 21 When anyone presents a peace offering to the LORD from the herd or the
flock in fulfillment of a vow, or as a free-will offering, if it is to find acceptance, it must be
unblemished; it shall not have any defect. 22 One that is blind or crippled or maimed, or one that
has a running sore or mange or ringworm, you shall not offer to the LORD; do not put such an
animal on the altar as an oblation to the LORD. 23 An ox or a sheep that is in any way illproportioned or stunted you may indeed present as a free-will offering, but it will not be
acceptable as a votive offering. 24 One that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn out or cut
off you shall not offer to the LORD. You shall neither do this in your own land 25 nor receive
from a foreigner any such animals to offer up as the food of your God; since they are deformed
or defective, they will not be acceptable for you.”
26 The LORD said to Moses, 27 “When an ox or a lamb or a goat is born, it shall remain
with its mother for seven days; only from the eighth day onward will it be acceptable, to be
offered as an oblation to the LORD. 28 You shall not slaughter an ox or a sheep on one and the
same day with its young. 29 Whenever you offer a thanksgiving sacrifice to the LORD, so offer
it that it may be acceptable for you; 30 it must, therefore, be eaten on the same day; none of it
shall be left over until the next day. I am the LORD.
31 “Be careful to observe the commandments which I, the LORD, give you, 32 and do not
profane my holy name; in the midst of the Israelites I, the LORD, must be held as sacred. It is I
who made you sacred 33 and led you out of the land of Egypt, that I, the LORD, might be your
God.”

Lev. 23
Holy Days. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: The
following are the festivals of the LORD, my feast days, which you shall celebrate with a sacred
assembly.
The Sabbath. 3 “For six days work may be done; but the seventh day is the sabbath rest, a
day for sacred assembly, on which you shall do no work. The sabbath shall belong to the LORD
wherever you dwell.
Passover. 4 “These, then, are the festivals of the LORD which you shall celebrate at their
proper time with a sacred assembly. 5 The Passover of the LORD falls on the fourteenth day of
the first month, at the evening twilight. 6 The fifteenth day of this month is the LORD’S feast of
Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. 7 On the first of these days
you shall hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work. 8 On each of the seven days you shall
offer an oblation to the LORD. Then on the seventh day you shall again hold a sacred assembly
and do no sort of work.”
9 The LORD said to Moses, 10 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you come into
the land which I am giving you, and reap your harvest, you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits
of your harvest to the priest, 11 who shall wave the sheaf before the LORD that it may be
acceptable for you. On the day after the sabbath the priest shall do this. 12 On this day, when
your sheaf is waved, you shall offer to the LORD for a holocaust an unblemished yearling lamb.
13 Its cereal offering shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as a sweetsmelling oblation to the LORD; and its libation shall be a fourth of a hin of wine. 14 Until this
day, when you bring your God this offering, you shall not eat any bread or roasted grain or fresh
kernels. This shall be a perpetual statute for you and your descendants wherever you dwell.
Pentecost. 15 “Beginning with the day after the sabbath, the day on which you bring the
wave-offering sheaf, you shall count seven full weeks, 16 and then on the day after the seventh
week, the fiftieth day, you shall present the new cereal offering to the LORD. 17 For the wave
offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall bring with you from wherever you live two
loaves of bread made of two tenths of an ephah of fine flour and baked with leaven. 18 Besides
the bread, you shall offer to the LORD a holocaust of seven unblemished yearling lambs, one
young bull, and two rams, along with their cereal offering and libations, as a sweet-smelling
oblation to the LORD. 19 One male goat shall be sacrificed as a sin offering, and two yearling
lambs as a peace offering. 20 The priest shall wave the bread of the first fruits and the two lambs
as a wave offering before the LORD; these shall be sacred to the LORD and belong to the priest.
21 On this same day you shall by proclamation have a sacred assembly, and no sort of work may
be done. This shall be a perpetual statute for you and your descendants wherever you dwell.
22 “When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not be so thorough that you reap the
field to its very edge, nor shall you glean the stray ears of your grain. These things you shall
leave for the poor and the alien. I, the LORD, am your God.”
New Year’s Day. 23 The LORD said to Moses, 24 “Tell the Israelites: On the first day of
the seventh month you shall keep a sabbath rest, with a sacred assembly and with the trumpet
blasts as a reminder; 25 you shall then do no sort of work, and you shall offer an oblation to the
LORD.”
The Day of Atonement. 26 The LORD said to Moses, 27 “The tenth of this seventh month
is the Day of Atonement, when you shall hold a sacred assembly and mortify yourselves and
offer an oblation to the LORD. 28 On this day you shall not do any work, because it is the Day
of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD, your God. 29 Anyone who
does not mortify himself on this day shall be cut off from his people, 30 and if anyone does any
work on this day, I will remove him from the midst of his people. 31 This is a perpetual statute
for you and your descendants wherever you dwell: you shall do no work, 32 but shall keep a
sabbath of complete rest and mortify yourselves. Beginning on the evening of the ninth of the
Books of Moses

112

month, you shall keep this sabbath of yours from evening to evening.”
The Feast of Booths. 33 The LORD said to Moses, 34 “Tell the Israelites: The fifteenth
day of this seventh month is the LORD’S feast of Booths, which shall continue for seven days.
35 On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly, and you shall do no sort of work. 36 For
seven days you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, and on the eighth day you shall again hold a
sacred assembly and offer an oblation to the LORD. On that solemn closing you shall do no sort
of work.
37 “These, therefore, are the festivals of the LORD on which you shall proclaim a sacred
assembly, and offer as an oblation to the LORD holocausts and cereal offerings, sacrifices and
libations, as prescribed for each day, 38 in addition to those of the LORD’S sabbaths, your
donations, your various votive offerings and the free-will offerings that you present to the
LORD.
39 “On the fifteenth day, then, of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce
of the land, you shall celebrate a pilgrim feast of the LORD for a whole week. The first and the
eighth day shall be days of complete rest. 40 On the first day you shall gather foliage from
majestic trees, branches of palms and boughs of myrtles and of valley poplars, and then for a
week you shall make merry before the LORD, your God. 41 By perpetual statute for you and
your descendants you shall keep this pilgrim feast of the LORD for one whole week in the
seventh month of the year. 42 During this week every native Israelite among you shall dwell in
booths, 43 that your descendants may realize that, when I led the Israelites out of the land of
Egypt, I made them dwell in booths. I, the LORD, am your God.”
44 Thus did Moses announce to the Israelites the festivals of the LORD.
Lev. 24
The Sanctuary Light. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Order the Israelites to bring you
clear oil of crushed olives for the light, so that you may keep lamps burning regularly. 3 In the
meeting tent, outside the veil that hangs in front of the commandments, Aaron shall set up the
lamps to burn before the LORD regularly, from evening till morning. Thus, by a perpetual statute
for you and your descendants, 4 the lamps shall be set up on the pure gold lampstand, to burn
regularly before the LORD.
The Showbread. 5 “You shall take fine flour and bake it into twelve cakes, using two tenths
of an ephah of flour for each cake. 6 These you shall place in two piles, six in each pile, on the
pure gold table before the LORD. 7 On each pile put some pure frankincense, which shall serve
as an oblation to the LORD, a token offering for the bread. 8 Regularly on each sabbath day this
bread shall be set out afresh before the LORD, offered on the part of the Israelites by an
everlasting agreement. 9 It shall belong to Aaron and his sons, who must eat it in a sacred place,
since, as something most sacred among the various oblations to the LORD, it is his by perpetual
right.”
Punishment of Blasphemy. 10 Among the Israelites there was a man born of an Israelite
mother (Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan) and an Egyptian father. 11 This man
quarreled publicly with another Israelite and cursed and blasphemed the LORD’S name. So the
people brought him to Moses, 12 who kept him in custody till a decision from the LORD should
settle the case for them. 13 The LORD then said to Moses, 14 “Take the blasphemer outside the
camp, and when all who heard him have laid their hands on his head, let the whole community
stone him. 15 Tell the Israelites: Anyone who curses his God shall bear the penalty of his sin; 16
whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall be put to death. The whole community shall
stone him; alien and native alike must be put to death for blaspheming the LORD’S name.
17 “Whoever takes the life of any human being shall be put to death; 18 whoever takes the
life of an animal shall make restitution of another animal. A life for a life! 19 Anyone who
inflicts an injury on his neighbor shall receive the same in return. 20 Limb for limb, eye for eye,
Books of Moses

113

tooth for tooth! The same injury that a man gives another shall be inflicted on him in return. 21
Whoever slays an animal shall make restitution, but whoever slays a man shall be put to death.
22 You shall have but one rule, for alien and native alike. I, the LORD, am your God.”
23 When Moses told this to the Israelites, they took the blasphemer outside the camp and
stoned him; they carried out the command that the LORD had given Moses.
Lev. 25
The Sabbatical Year. 1 The LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai, 2 “Speak to the
Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, let the land, too, keep a
sabbath for the LORD. 3 For six years you may sow your field, and for six years prune your
vineyard, gathering in their produce. 4 But during the seventh year the land shall have a complete
rest, a sabbath for the LORD, when you may neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard. 5
The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, nor shall you pick the grapes of your
untrimmed vines in this year of sabbath rest for the land. 6 While the land has its sabbath, all its
produce will be food equally for you yourself and for your male and female slaves, for your hired
help and the tenants who live with you, 7 and likewise for your livestock and for the wild
animals on your land.
The Jubilee Year. 8 “Seven weeks of years shall you count—seven times seven years—so
that the seven cycles amount to forty-nine years. 9 Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month
let the trumpet resound; on this, the Day of Atonement, the trumpet blast shall re-echo
throughout your land. 10 This fiftieth year you shall make sacred by proclaiming liberty in the
land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when every one of you shall return to his
own property, every one to his own family estate. 11 In this fiftieth year, your year of jubilee,
you shall not sow, nor shall you reap the aftergrowth or pick the grapes from the untrimmed
vines. 12 Since this is the jubilee, which shall be sacred for you, you may not eat of its produce,
except as taken directly from the field.
13 “In this year of jubilee, then, every one of you shall return to his own property. 14
Therefore, when you sell any land to your neighbor or buy any from him, do not deal unfairly. 15
On the basis of the number of years since the last jubilee shall you purchase the land from him;
and so also, on the basis of the number of years for crops, shall he sell it to you. 16 When the
years are many, the price shall be so much the more; when the years are few, the price shall be so
much the less. For it is really the number of crops that he sells you. 17 Do not deal unfairly, then;
but stand in fear of your God. I, the LORD, am your God.
18 “Observe my precepts and be careful to keep my regulations, for then you will dwell
securely in the land. 19 The land will yield its fruit and you will have food in abundance, so that
you may live there without worry. 20 Therefore, do not say, ‘What shall we eat in the seventh
year, if we do not then sow or reap our crop?’ 21 I will bestow such blessings on you in the sixth
year that there will then be crop enough for three years. 22 When you sow in the eighth year, you
will continue to eat from the old crop; and even into the ninth year, when the crop comes in, you
will still have the old to eat from.
Redemption of Property. 23 “The land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine,
and you are but aliens who have become my tenants. 24 Therefore, in every part of the country
that you occupy, you must permit the land to be redeemed. 25 When one of your countrymen is
reduced to poverty and has to sell some of his property, his closest relative, who has the right to
redeem it, may go and buy back what his kinsman has sold. 26 If, however, the man has no
relative to redeem his land, but later on acquires sufficient means to buy it back in his own name,
27 he shall make a deduction from the price in proportion to the number of years since the sale,
and then pay back the balance to the one to whom he sold it, so that he may thus regain his own
property. 28 But if he does not acquire sufficient means to buy back his land, what he has sold
shall remain in the possession of the purchaser until the jubilee, when it must be released and
Books of Moses

114

returned to its original owner.
29 “When someone sells a dwelling in a walled town, he has the right to buy it back during
the time of one full year from its sale. 30 But if such a house in a walled town has not been
redeemed at the end of a full year, it shall belong in perpetuity to the purchaser and his
descendants; nor shall it be released in the jubilee. 31 However, houses in villages that are not
encircled by walls shall be considered as belonging to the surrounding farm land; they may be
redeemed at any time, and in the jubilee they must be released.
32 “In levitical cities the Levites shall always have the right to redeem the town houses that
are their property. 33 Any town house of the Levites in their cities that had been sold and not
redeemed, shall be released in the jubilee; for the town houses of the Levites are their hereditary
property in the midst of the Israelites. 34 Moreover, the pasture land belonging to their cities
shall not be sold at all; it must always remain their hereditary property.
35 “When one of your fellow countrymen is reduced to poverty and is unable to hold out
beside you, extend to him the privileges of an alien or a tenant, so that he may continue to live
with you. 36 Do not exact interest from your countryman either in money or in kind, but out of
fear of God let him live with you. 37 You are to lend him neither money at interest nor food at a
profit. 38 I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the
land of Canaan and to be your God.
39 “When, then, your countryman becomes so impoverished beside you that he sells you his
services, do not make him work as a slave. 40 Rather, let him be like a hired servant or like your
tenant, working with you until the jubilee year, 41 when he, together with his children, shall be
released from your service and return to his kindred and to the property of his ancestors. 42 Since
those whom I brought out of the land of Egypt are servants of mine, they shall not be sold as
slaves to any man. 43 Do not lord it over them harshly, but stand in fear of your God.
44 “Slaves, male and female, you may indeed possess, provided you buy them from among
the neighboring nations. 45 You may also buy them from among the aliens who reside with you
and from their children who are born and reared in your land. Such slaves you may own as
chattels, 46 and leave to your sons as their hereditary property, making them perpetual slaves.
But you shall not lord it harshly over any of the Israelites, your kinsmen.
47 “When one of your countrymen is reduced to such poverty that he sells himself to a
wealthy alien who has a permanent or a temporary residence among you, or to one of the
descendants of an immigrant family, 48 even after he has thus sold his services he still has the
right of redemption; he may be redeemed by one of his own brothers, 49 or by his uncle or
cousin, or by some other relative or fellow clansman; or, if he acquires the means, he may
redeem himself. 50 With his purchaser he shall compute the years from the sale to the jubilee,
distributing the sale price over these years as though he had been hired as a day laborer. 51 The
more such years there are, the more of the sale price he shall pay back as ransom; 52 the fewer
years there are left before the jubilee year, the more he has to his credit; in proportion to his years
of service shall he pay his ransom. 53 The alien shall treat him as a servant hired on an annual
basis, and he shall not lord it over him harshly under your very eyes. 54 If he is not thus
redeemed, he shall nevertheless be released, together with his children, in the jubilee year. 55 For
to me the Israelites belong as servants; they are servants of mine, because I brought them out of
the land of Egypt, I, the LORD, your God.
Lev. 26
The Rewards of Obedience. 1 “Do not make false gods for yourselves. You shall not erect
an idol or a sacred pillar for yourselves, nor shall you set up a stone figure for worship in your
land; for I, the LORD, am your God. 2 Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am the
LORD.
3 “If you live in accordance with my precepts and are careful to observe my
Books of Moses

115

commandments, 4 I will give you rain in due season, so that the land will bear its crops, and the
trees their fruit; 5 your threshing will last till vintage time, and your vintage till the time for
sowing, and you will have food to eat in abundance, so that you may dwell securely in your land.
6 I will establish peace in the land, that you may lie down to rest without anxiety. I will rid the
country of ravenous beasts, and keep the sword of war from sweeping across your land. 7 You
will rout your enemies and lay them low with your sword. 8 Five of you will put a hundred of
your foes to flight, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand of them, till they are cut down
by your sword. 9 I will look with favor upon you, and make you fruitful and numerous, as I carry
out my covenant with you. 10 So much of the old crops will you have stored up for food that you
will have to discard them to make room for the new. 11 I will set my Dwelling among you, and
will not disdain you. 12 Ever present in your midst, I will be your God, and you will be my
people; 13 for it is I, the LORD, your God, who brought you out of the land of the Egyptians and
freed you from their slavery, breaking the yoke they had laid upon you and letting you walk
erect.
Punishment of Disobedience. 14 “But if you do not heed me and do not keep all these
commandments, 15 if you reject my precepts and spurn my decrees, refusing to obey all my
commandments and breaking my covenant, 16 then I, in turn, will give you your deserts. I will
punish you with terrible woes—with wasting and fever to dim the eyes and sap the life. You will
sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will consume the crop. 17 I will turn against you, till
you are beaten down before your enemies and lorded over by your foes. You will take to flight
though no one pursues you.
18 “If even after this you do not obey me, I will increase the chastisement for your sins
sevenfold, 19 to break your haughty confidence. I will make the sky above you as hard as iron,
and your soil as hard as bronze, 20 so that your strength will be spent in vain; your land will bear
no crops, and its trees no fruit.
21 “If then you become defiant in your unwillingness to obey me, I will multiply my blows
another sevenfold, as your sins deserve. 22 I will unleash the wild beasts against you, to rob you
of your children and wipe out your livestock, till your population dwindles away and your roads
become deserted.
23 “If, with all this, you still refuse to be chastened by me and continue to defy me, 24 I, too,
will defy you and will smite you for your sins seven times harder than before. 25 I will make the
sword, the avenger of my covenant, sweep over you. Though you then huddle together in your
walled cities, I will send in pestilence among you, till you are forced to surrender to the enemy.
26 And as I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will need but one oven for baking all the
bread they dole out to you in rations—not enough food to still your hunger.
27 “If, despite all this, you still persist in disobeying and defying me, 28 I, also, will meet
you with fiery defiance and will chastise you with sevenfold fiercer punishment for your sins, 29
till you begin to eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters. 30 I will demolish your high
places, overthrow your incense stands, and cast your corpses on those of your idols. In my
abhorrence of you, 31 I will lay waste your cities and devastate your sanctuaries, refusing to
accept your sweet-smelling offerings. 32 So devastated will I leave the land that your very
enemies who come to live there will stand aghast at the sight of it. 33 You yourselves I will
scatter among the nations at the point of my drawn sword, leaving your countryside desolate and
your cities deserted. 34 Then shall the land retrieve its lost sabbaths during all the time it lies
waste, while you are in the land of your enemies; then shall the land have rest and make up for
its sabbaths 35 during all the time that it lies desolate, enjoying the rest that you would not let it
have on the sabbaths when you lived there.
36 “Those of you who survive in the lands of their enemies I will make so fainthearted that,
if leaves rustle behind them, they will flee headlong, as if from the sword, though no one pursues
them; 37 stumbling over one another as if to escape a weapon, while no one is after them—so
Books of Moses

116

helpless will you be to take a stand against your foes! 38 You will be lost among the Gentiles,
swallowed up in your enemies’ country. 39 Those of you who survive in the lands of their
enemies will waste away for their own and their fathers’ guilt.
40 “Thus they will have to confess that they and their fathers were guilty of having rebelled
against me and of having defied me, 41 so that I, too, had to defy them and bring them into their
enemies’ land. Then, when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they make amends for
their guilt, 42 I will remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and my
covenant with Abraham; and of the land, too, I will be mindful. 43 But the land must first be rid
of them, that in its desolation it may make up its lost sabbaths, and that they, too, may make
good the debt of their guilt for having spurned my precepts and abhorred my statutes. 44 Yet
even so, even while they are in their enemies’ land, I will not reject or spurn them, lest, by
wiping them out, I make void my covenant with them; for I, the LORD, am their God. 45 I will
remember them because of the covenant I made with their forefathers, whom I brought out of the
land of Egypt under the very eyes of the Gentiles, that I, the LORD, might be their God.”
46 These are the precepts, decrees and laws which the LORD had Moses promulgate on
Mount Sinai in the pact between himself and the Israelites.
V. REDEMPTION OF OFFERINGS
Lev. 27
Redemption of Votive Offerings. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the Israelites
and tell them: When anyone fulfills a vow of offering one or more persons to the LORD, who are
to be ransomed at a fixed sum of money, 3 for persons between the ages of twenty and sixty, the
fixed sum, in sanctuary shekels, shall be fifty silver shekels for a man, 4 and thirty shekels for a
woman; 5 for persons between the ages of five and twenty, the fixed sum shall be twenty shekels
for a youth, and ten for a maiden; 6 for persons between the ages of one month and five years,
the fixed sum shall be five silver shekels for a boy, and three for a girl; 7 for persons of sixty or
more, the fixed sum shall be fifteen shekels for a man, and ten for a woman. 8 However, if the
one who took the vow is too poor to meet the fixed sum, the person must be set before the priest,
who shall determine the sum for his ransom in keeping with the means of the one who made the
vow.
9 “If the offering vowed to the LORD is an animal that may be sacrificed, every such
animal, when vowed to the LORD, becomes sacred. 10 The offerer shall not present a substitute
for it by exchanging either a better for a worse one or a worse for a better one. If he attempts to
offer one animal in place of another, both the original and its substitute shall be treated as sacred.
11 If the animal vowed to the LORD is unclean and therefore unfit for sacrifice, it must be set
before the priest, 12 who shall determine its value in keeping with its good or bad qualities, and
the value set by the priest shall stand. 13 If the offerer wishes to redeem the animal, he shall pay
one fifth more than this valuation.
14 “When someone dedicates his house as sacred to the LORD, the priest shall determine its
value in keeping with its good or bad points, and the value set by the priest shall stand. 15 If the
one who dedicated his house wishes to redeem it, he shall pay one fifth more than the price thus
established, and then it will again be his.
16 “If the object which someone dedicates to the LORD is a piece of his hereditary land, its
valuation shall be made according to the amount of seed required to sow it, the acreage sown
with a homer of barley seed being valued at fifty silver shekels. 17 If the dedication of a field is
made at the beginning of a jubilee period, the full valuation shall hold; 18 but if it is some time
after this, the priest shall estimate its money value according to the number of years left until the
next jubilee year, with a corresponding rebate on the valuation. 19 If the one who dedicated his
field wishes to redeem it, he shall pay one fifth more than the price thus established, and so
reclaim it. 20 If, instead of redeeming such a field, he sells it to someone else, it may no longer
Books of Moses

117

be redeemed; 21 but at the jubilee it shall be released as sacred to the LORD; like a field that is
doomed, it shall become priestly property.
22 “If the field that some man dedicates to the LORD is one he had purchased and not a part
of his hereditary property, 23 the priest shall compute its value in proportion to the number of
years until the next jubilee, and on the same day the price thus established shall be given as
sacred to the LORD; 24 at the jubilee, however, the field shall revert to the hereditary owner of
this land from whom it had been purchased.
25 “Every valuation shall be made according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel. There
are twenty gerahs to the shekel.
Offerings Not to be Redeemed. 26 “Note that a first-born animal, which as such already
belongs to the LORD, may not be dedicated by vow to him. If it is an ox or a sheep, it shall be
ceded to the LORD; 27 but if it is an unclean animal, it may be redeemed by paying one fifth
more than its fixed value. If it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at its fixed value.
28 “Note, also, that any one of his possessions which a man vows as doomed to the LORD,
whether it is a human being or an animal or a hereditary field, shall be neither sold nor
ransomed; everything that is thus doomed becomes most sacred to the LORD. 29 All human
beings that are doomed lose the right to be redeemed; they must be put to death.
30 “All tithes of the land, whether in grain from the fields or in fruit from the trees, belong
to the LORD, as sacred to him. 31 If someone wishes to buy back any of his tithes, he shall pay
one fifth more than their value. 32 The tithes of the herd and the flock shall be determined by
ceding to the LORD as sacred every tenth animal as they are counted by the herdsman’s rod. 33
It shall not matter whether good ones or bad ones are thus chosen, and no exchange may be
made. If any exchange is attempted, both the original animal and its substitute shall be treated as
sacred, without the right of being bought back.”
34 These are the commandments which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai.

NUMBERS
I. PREPARATION FOR THE DEPARTURE FROM SINAI
Num. 1
The Census. 1 In the year following that of the Israelites’ departure from the land of Egypt,
on the first day of the second month, the LORD said to Moses in the meeting tent in the desert of
Sinai: 2 “Take a census of the whole community of the Israelites, by clans and ancestral houses,
registering each male individually. 3 You and Aaron shall enroll in companies all the men in
Israel of twenty years or more who are fit for military service.
Moses’ Assistants. 4 “To assist you there shall be a man from each tribe, the head of his
ancestral house. 5 These are the names of those who are to assist you: from Reuben: Elizur, son
of Shedeur; 6 from Simeon: Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai; 7 from Judah: Nahshon, son of
Amminadab; 8 from Issachar: Nethanel, son of Zuar; 9 from Zebulun: Eliab, son of Helon; 10
from Ephraim: Elishama, son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh: Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, for
the descendants of Joseph; 11 from Benjamin: Abidan, son of Gideoni; 12 from Dan: Ahiezer,
son of Ammishaddai; 13 from Asher: Pagiel, son of Ochran; 14 from Gad: Eliasaph, son of
Reuel; 15 from Naphtali: Ahira, son of Enan.”
16 These were councilors of the community, princes of their ancestral tribes, chiefs of the
troops of Israel. 17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated, 18 and
assembled the whole community on the first day of the second month. Every man of twenty
years or more then declared his name and lineage according to clan and ancestral house, 19 as
the LORD had commanded Moses.
Count of the Twelve Tribes. This is their census as taken in the desert of Sinai. 20 Of the
descendants of Reuben, the first-born of Israel, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral
houses: when all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled,
21 forty-six thousand five hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Reuben.
22 Of the descendants of Simeon, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when
all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 23 fifty-nine
thousand three hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Simeon.
24 Of the descendants of Gad, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when all
the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 25 forty-five
thousand six hundred and fifty were enrolled in the tribe of Gad.
26 Of the descendants of Judah, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when all
the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 27 seventy-four
thousand six hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Judah.
28 Of the descendants of Issachar, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when
all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 29 fifty-four
thousand four hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Issachar.
30 Of the descendants of Zebulun, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when
all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 31 fiftyseven thousand four hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Zebulun.
32 Of the descendants of Joseph Of the descendants of Ephraim, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when all
the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 33 forty
thousand five hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Ephraim.
34 Of the descendants of Manasseh, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses:
when all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 35
thirty-two thousand two hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Manasseh.
36 Of the descendants of Benjamin, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses:
when all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 37
Books of Moses

119

thirty-five thousand four hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Benjamin.
38 Of the descendants of Dan, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when all
the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 39 sixty-two
thousand seven hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Dan.
40 Of the descendants of Asher, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when all
the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 41 forty-one
thousand five hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Asher.
42 Of the descendants of Naphtali, registered by lineage in clans and ancestral houses: when
all the males of twenty years or more who were fit for military service were polled, 43 fifty-three
thousand four hundred were enrolled in the tribe of Naphtali.
44 It was these who were registered, each according to his ancestral house, in the census
taken by Moses and Aaron and the twelve princes of Israel. 45 The total number of the Israelites
of twenty years or more who were fit for military service, registered by ancestral houses, 46 was
six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
Levites Omitted in the Census. 47 The Levites, however, were not registered by ancestral
tribe with the others. 48 For the LORD had told Moses, 49 “The tribe of Levi alone you shall not
enroll nor include in the census along with the other Israelites. 50 You are to give the Levites
charge of the Dwelling of the commandments with all its equipment and all that belongs to it. It
is they who shall carry the Dwelling with all its equipment and who shall be its ministers. They
shall therefore camp around the Dwelling. 51 When the Dwelling is to move on, the Levites shall
take it down; when the Dwelling is to be pitched, it is the Levites who shall set it up. Any layman
who comes near it shall be put to death. 52 While the other Israelites shall camp by companies,
each in his own division of the camp, 53 the Levites shall camp around the Dwelling of the
commandments. Otherwise God’s wrath will strike the Israelite community. The Levites, then,
shall have charge of the Dwelling of the commandments.” 54 All this the Israelites fulfilled as
the LORD had commanded Moses.
Num. 2
Arrangement of the Tribes. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 2 “The Israelites shall
camp, each in his own division, under the ensigns of their ancestral houses. They shall camp
around the meeting tent, but at some distance from it.
3 “Encamped on the east side, toward the sunrise, shall be the divisional camp of Judah,
arranged in companies. (The prince of the Judahites was Nahshon, son of Amminadab, 4 and his
soldiers amounted in the census to seventy-four thousand six hundred.) 5 With Judah shall camp
the tribe of Issachar (Their prince was Nethanel, son of Zuar, 6 and his soldiers amounted in the
census to fifty-four thousand four hundred.) 7 and the tribe of Zebulun. (Their prince was Eliab,
son of Helon, 8 and his soldiers amounted in the census to fifty-seven thousand four hundred. 9
The total number of those registered by companies in the camp of Judah was one hundred and
eighty-six thousand four hundred.) These shall be first on the march.
10 “On the south side shall be the divisional camp of Reuben, arranged in companies. (Their
prince was Elizur, son of Shedeur, 11 and his soldiers amounted in the census to forty-six
thousand five hundred.) 12 Beside them shall camp the tribe of Simeon (Their prince was
Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai, 13 and his soldiers amounted in the census to fifty-nine thousand
three hundred.) 14 and next the tribe of Gad. (Their prince was Eliasaph, son of Reuel, 15 and his
soldiers amounted in the census to forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty. 16 The total number
of those registered by companies in the camp of Reuben was one hundred and fifty-one thousand
four hundred and fifty.) These shall be second on the march.
17 “Then the meeting tent and the camp of the Levites shall set out in the middle of the line.
As in camp, so also on the march, every man shall be in his proper place, with his own division.
18 “On the west side shall be the divisional camp of Ephraim, arranged in companies. (Their
Books of Moses

120

prince was Elishama, son of Ammihud, 19 and his soldiers amounted in the census to forty
thousand five hundred.) 20 Beside them shall camp the tribe of Manasseh (Their prince was
Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, 21 and his soldiers amounted in the census to thirty-two thousand
two hundred.) 22 and the tribe of Benjamin. (Their prince was Abidan, son of Gideoni, 23 and
his soldiers amounted in the census to thirty-five thousand four hundred. 24 The total number of
those registered by companies in the camp of Ephraim was one hundred and eight thousand one
hundred.) These shall be third on the march.
25 “On the north side shall be the divisional camp of Dan, arranged in companies. (Their
prince was Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai, 26 and his soldiers amounted in the census to sixtytwo thousand seven hundred.) 27 Beside them shall camp the tribe of Asher (Their prince was
Pagiel, son of Ochran, 28 and his soldiers amounted in the census to forty-one thousand five
hundred.) 29 and next the tribe of Naphtali. (Their prince was Ahira, son of Enan, 30 and his
soldiers amounted in the census to fifty-three thousand four hundred. 31 The total number of
those registered by companies in the camp of Dan was one hundred and fifty-seven thousand six
hundred.) These shall be the last of the divisions on the march.”
32 This was the census of the Israelites taken by ancestral houses. The total number of those
registered by companies in the camps was six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
33 The Levites, however, were not registered with the other Israelites, for so the LORD had
commanded Moses. 34 The Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses; both in
camp and on the march they were in their own divisions, every man according to his clan and his
ancestral house.
Num. 3
The Sons of Aaron. 1 The following were the descendants of Aaron and Moses at the time
that the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. 2 The sons of Aaron were Nadab his first-born,
Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests
who were ordained to exercise the priesthood. 4 But when Nadab and Abihu offered profane fire
before the LORD in the desert of Sinai, they met death in the presence of the LORD, and left no
sons. Thereafter only Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly functions under the direction of
their father Aaron.
Levites in Place of First Born. 5 Now the LORD said to Moses: 6 “Summon the tribe of
Levi and present them to Aaron the priest, as his assistants. 7 They shall discharge his
obligations and those of the whole community before the meeting tent by serving at the
Dwelling. 8 They shall have custody of all the furnishings of the meeting tent and discharge the
duties of the Israelites in the service of the Dwelling. 9 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and
his sons; they have been set aside from among the Israelites as dedicated to me. 10 But only
Aaron and his descendants shall you appoint to have charge of the priestly functions. Any
layman who comes near shall be put to death.”
11 The LORD said to Moses, 12 “It is I who have chosen the Levites from the Israelites in
place of every first-born that opens the womb among the Israelites. The Levites, therefore, are
mine, 13 because every first-born is mine. When I slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I
made all the first-born in Israel sacred to me, both of man and of beast. They belong to me; I am
the LORD.”
Census of Levites. 14 The LORD said to Moses in the desert of Sinai, 15 “Take a census of
the Levites by ancestral houses and clans, registering every male of a month or more.” 16 Moses,
therefore, took their census in accordance with the command the LORD had given him. 17 The
sons of Levi were named Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 18 The descendants of Gershon, by clans,
were named Libni and Shimei. 19 The descendants of Kohath, by clans, were Amram, Izhar,
Hebron and Uzziel. 20 The descendants of Merari, by clans, were Mahli and Mushi. These were
the clans of the Levites by ancestral houses.
Books of Moses

121

Duties of the Levitical Clans. 21 To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the
clan of the Shimeites; these were the clans of the Gershonites. 22 When all their males of a
month or more were registered, they numbered seven thousand five hundred. 23 The clans of the
Gershonites camped behind the Dwelling, to the west. 24 The prince of their ancestral house was
Eliasaph, son of Lael. 25 At the meeting tent they had charge of whatever pertained to the
Dwelling, the tent and its covering, the curtain at the entrance of the meeting tent, 26 the
hangings of the court, the curtain at the entrance of the court enclosing both the Dwelling and the
altar, and the ropes.
27 To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites. 28 When all their males of a month or more
were registered, they numbered eight thousand three hundred. They had charge of the sanctuary.
29 The clans of the Kohathites camped at the south side of the Dwelling. 30 The prince of their
ancestral house was Elizaphan, son of Uzziel. 31 They had charge of whatever pertained to the
ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils with which the ministry of the sanctuary was
exercised, and the veil. 32 The chief prince of the Levites, however, was Eleazar, son of Aaron
the priest; he was supervisor over those who had charge of the sanctuary.
33 To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the clans of
Merari. 34 When all their males of a month or more were registered, they numbered six thousand
two hundred. 35 The prince of the ancestral house of the clans of Merari was Zuriel, son of
Abihail. They camped at the north side of the Dwelling. 36 The Merarites were charged with the
care of whatever pertained to the boards of the Dwelling, its bars, columns, pedestals, and all its
fittings, 37 as well as the columns of the surrounding court with their pedestals, pegs and ropes.
38 East of the Dwelling, that is, in front of the meeting tent, toward the sunrise, were
camped Moses and Aaron and the latter’s sons. They discharged the obligations of the sanctuary
for the Israelites. Any layman who came near was to be put to death.
39 The total number of male Levites a month old or more whom Moses had registered by
clans in keeping with the LORD’S command, was twenty-two thousand.
Census & Ransom of First-Born. 40 The LORD then said to Moses, “Take a census of all
the first-born males of the Israelites a month old or more, and compute their total number. 41
Then assign the Levites to me, the LORD, in place of all the first-born of the Israelites, as well as
their cattle in place of all the first-born among the cattle of the Israelites.” 42 So Moses took a
census of all the first-born of the Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him. 43 When all the
first-born males of a month or more were registered, they numbered twenty-two thousand two
hundred and seventy-three.
44 The LORD said to Moses: 45 “Take the Levites in place of all the first-born of the
Israelites, and the Levites’ cattle in place of their cattle, that the Levites may belong to me. I am
the LORD. 46 As ransom for the two hundred and seventy-three first-born of the Israelites who
outnumber the Levites, 47 you shall take five shekels for each individual, according to the
standard of the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. 48 Give this silver to Aaron and his
sons as ransom for the extra number.” 49 So Moses took the silver as ransom from those who
were left when the rest had been redeemed by the Levites. 50 From the first-born of the Israelites
he received in silver one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels according to the
sanctuary standard. 51 He then gave this ransom silver to Aaron and his sons, as the LORD had
commanded him.
Num. 4
Duties Further Defined. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 2 “Among the Levites
take a total of the Kohathites, by clans and ancestral houses, all the men of the Kohathites 3
between thirty and fifty years of age; these are to undertake obligatory tasks in the meeting tent.
4 “The service of the Kohathites in the meeting tent concerns the most sacred objects. 5 In
Books of Moses

122

breaking camp, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the screening curtain and cover the
ark of the commandments with it. 6 Over these they shall put a cover of tahash skin, and on top
of this spread an all-violet cloth. They shall then put the poles in place. 7 On the table of the
Presence they shall spread a violet cloth and put on it the plates and cups, as well as the bowls
and pitchers for libations; the established bread offering shall remain on the table. 8 Over these
they shall spread a scarlet cloth and cover all this with tahash skin. They shall then put the poles
in place. 9 They shall use a violet cloth to cover the lampstand with its lamps, trimming shears,
and trays, as well as the various containers of oil from which it is supplied. 10 The lampstand
with all its utensils they shall then enclose in a covering of tahash skin, and place on a litter. 11
Over the golden altar they shall spread a violet cloth, and cover this also with a covering of
tahash skin. They shall then put the poles in place. 12 Taking the utensils of the sanctuary
service, they shall wrap them all in violet cloth and cover them with tahash skin. They shall then
place them on a litter. 13 After cleansing the altar of its ashes, they shall spread a purple cloth
over it. 14 On this they shall put all the utensils with which it is served: the fire pans, forks,
shovels, basins, and all the utensils of the altar. They shall then spread a covering of tahash skin
over this, and put the poles in place.
15 “Only after Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sacred objects and all their
utensils on breaking camp, shall the Kohathites enter to carry them. But they shall not touch the
sacred objects; if they do they will die. These, then, are the objects in the meeting tent that the
Kohathites shall carry.
16 “Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, shall be in charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant
incense, the established cereal offering, and the anointing oil. He shall be in charge of the whole
Dwelling with all the sacred objects and utensils that are in it.”
17 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 18 “Do not let the group of Kohathite clans perish
from the body of the Levites. 19 That they may live and not die when they approach the most
sacred objects, this is what you shall do for them: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign to
each of them his task and what he must carry; 20 but the Kohathites shall not go in to look upon
the sacred objects, even for an instant; if they do, they will die.”
21 The LORD said to Moses, 22 “Take a total among the Gershonites also, by ancestral
houses and clans, 23 of all the men between thirty and fifty years of age; these are to undertake
obligatory tasks in the meeting tent. 24 This is the task of the clans of the Gershonites, what they
must do and what they must carry: 25 they shall carry the sheets of the Dwelling, the meeting
tent with its covering and the outer wrapping of tahash skin, the curtain at the entrance of the
meeting tent, 26 the hangings of the court, the curtain at the entrance of the court that encloses
both the Dwelling and the altar, together with their ropes and all other objects necessary in their
use. Whatever is to be done with these things shall be their task. 27 The service of the
Gershonites shall be entirely under the direction of Aaron and his sons, with regard to what they
must do and what they must carry; you shall make each man of them responsible for what he is
to carry. 28 This, then, is the task of the Gershonites in the meeting tent; and they shall be under
the supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
29 “Among the Merarites, too, you shall enroll by clans and ancestral houses 30 all their
men between thirty and fifty years of age; these are to undertake obligatory tasks in the meeting
tent. 31 This is what they shall be responsible for carrying, all the years of their service in the
meeting tent: the boards of the Dwelling with its bars, columns and pedestals, 32 and the
columns of the surrounding court with their pedestals, pegs and ropes. You shall designate for
each man of them all the objects connected with his service, which he shall be responsible for
carrying. 33 This, then, is the task of the clans of the Merarites during all their service in the
meeting tent under the supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.”
Number of Adult Levites. 34 So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the community made
a registration among the Kohathites, by clans and ancestral houses, 35 of all the men between
Books of Moses

123

thirty and fifty years of age. These were to undertake obligatory tasks in the meeting tent; 36 as
registered by clans, they numbered two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 37 Such was the
census of all the men of the Kohathite clans who were to serve in the meeting tent, which Moses
took, together with Aaron, as the LORD bade him.
38 The registration was then made among the Gershonites, by clans and ancestral houses, 39
of all the men between thirty and fifty years of age. These were to undertake obligatory tasks in
the meeting tent; 40 as registered by clans and ancestral houses, they numbered two thousand six
hundred and thirty. 41 Such was the census of all the men of the Gershonite clans who were to
serve in the meeting tent, which Moses took, together with Aaron, at the LORD’S bidding.
42 Then the registration was made among the Merarites, by clans and ancestral houses, 43 of
all the men from thirty up to fifty years of age. These were to undertake obligatory tasks in the
meeting tent; 44 as registered by clans, they numbered three thousand two hundred. 45 Such was
the census of the men of the Merarite clans which Moses took, together with Aaron, as the
LORD bade him.
46 Therefore, when Moses and Aaron and the Israelites princes had completed the
registration among the Levites, by clans and ancestral houses, 47 of all the men between thirty
and fifty years of age who were to undertake tasks of service or transport of the meeting tent, 48
the total number registered was eight thousand five hundred and eighty. 49 According to the
LORD’S bidding to Moses, they gave them their individual assignments for service and for
transport; so the LORD had commanded Moses.
Num. 5
Unclean Expelled. 1 The LORD said to Moses: 2 “Order the Israelites to expel from camp
every leper, and everyone suffering from a discharge, and everyone who has become unclean by
contact with a corpse. 3 Male and female alike, you shall compel them to go out of the camp;
they are not to defile the camp in which I dwell.” 4 The Israelites obeyed the command that the
LORD had given Moses; they expelled them from the camp.
Unjust Possession. 5 The LORD said to Moses, 6 “Tell the Israelites: If a man (or a
woman) commits a fault against his fellow man and wrongs him, thus breaking faith with the
LORD, 7 he shall confess the wrong he has done, restore his ill-gotten goods in full, and in
addition give one fifth of their value to the one he has wronged. 8 However, if the latter has no
next of kin to whom restoration of the ill-gotten goods can be made, the goods to be restored
shall be the LORD’S and shall fall to the priest; this is apart from the atonement ram with which
the priest makes amends for the guilty man. 9 Likewise, every sacred contribution that the
Israelites are bound to make shall fall to the priest. 10 Each Israelite man may dispose of his own
sacred contributions; they become the property of the priest to whom he gives them.”
Ordeal for a Suspected Adulteress. 11 The LORD said to Moses, 12 “Speak to the
Israelites and tell them: If a man’s wife goes astray and becomes unfaithful to him 13 by having
intercourse with another man, though her husband has not sufficient evidence of the fact, so that
her impurity remains unproved for lack of a witness who might have caught her in the act; 14 or
if a man is overcome by a feeling of jealousy that makes him suspect his wife, whether she was
actually impure or not: 15 he shall bring his wife to the priest and shall take along as an offering
for her a tenth of an ephah of barley meal. However, he shall not pour oil on it nor put
frankincense over it, since it is a cereal offering of jealousy, a cereal offering for an appeal in a
question of guilt.
16 “The priest shall first have the woman come forward and stand before the LORD. 17 In
an earthen vessel he shall meanwhile put some holy water, as well as some dust that he has taken
from the floor of the Dwelling. 18 Then, as the woman stands before the LORD, the priest shall
uncover her head and place in her hands the cereal offering of her appeal, that is, the cereal
offering of jealousy, while he himself shall hold the bitter water that brings a curse. 19 Then he
Books of Moses

124

shall adjure the woman, saying to her, ‘If no other man has had intercourse with you, and you
have not gone astray by impurity while under the authority of your husband, be immune to the
curse brought by this bitter water. 20 But if you have gone astray while under the authority of
your husband and have acted impurely by letting a man other than your husband have intercourse
with you’— 21 so shall the priest adjure the woman with this oath of imprecation—‘may the
LORD make you an example of malediction and imprecation among your people by causing
your thighs to waste away and your belly to swell! 22 May this water, then, that brings a curse,
enter your body to make your belly swell and your thighs waste away!’ And the woman shall
say, ‘Amen, amen!’ 23 The priest shall put these imprecations in writing and shall then wash
them off into the bitter water, 24 which he is to have the woman drink, so that it may go into her
with all its bitter curse. 25 But first he shall take the cereal offering of jealousy from the
woman’s hand, and having waved this offering before the LORD, shall put it near the altar, 26
where he shall take a handful of the cereal offering as its token offering and burn it on the altar.
Only then shall he have the woman drink the water. 27 Once she has done so, if she has been
impure and unfaithful to her husband, this bitter water that brings a curse will go into her, and
her belly will swell and her thighs will waste away, so that she will become an example of
imprecation among her people. 28 If, however, the woman has not defiled herself, but is still
pure, she will be immune and will still be able to bear children.
29 “This, then, is the law for jealousy: When a woman goes astray while under the authority
of her husband and acts impurely, 30 or when such a feeling of jealousy comes over a man that
he becomes suspicious of his wife, he shall have her stand before the LORD, and the priest shall
apply this law in full to her. 31 The man shall be free from guilt, but the woman shall bear such
guilt as she may have.”
Num. 6
Laws Concerning Nazirites. 1 The LORD said to Moses: 2 “Speak to the Israelites and tell
them: When a man (or a woman) solemnly takes the nazirite vow to dedicate himself to the
LORD, 3 he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he may neither drink wine vinegar, other
vinegar, of any kind of grape juice, nor eat either fresh or dried grapes. 4 As long as he is a
nazirite he shall not eat anything of the produce of the vine; not even unripe grapes or
grapeskins. 5 While he is under the nazirite vow, no razor shall touch his hair. Until the period of
his dedication to the LORD is over, he shall be sacred, and shall let the hair of his head grow
freely. 6 As long as he is dedicated to the LORD, he shall not enter where a dead person is. 7 Not
even for his father or mother, his sister or brother, should they die, may he become unclean,
since his head bears his dedication to God. 8 As long as he is a nazirite he is sacred to the LORD.
9 “If someone dies very suddenly in his presence, so that his dedicated head becomes
unclean, he shall shave his head on the day of his purification, that is, on the seventh day. 10 On
the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the
meeting tent. 11 The priest shall offer up the one as a sin offering and the other as a holocaust,
thus making atonement for him for the sin he has committed by reason of the dead person. On
the same day he shall reconsecrate his head 12 and begin anew the period of his dedication to the
LORD as a nazirite, bringing a yearling lamb as a guilt offering. The previous period is not valid,
because his dedicated head became unclean.
13 “This is the ritual for the nazirite: On the day he completes the period of his dedication he
shall go to the entrance of the meeting tent, 14 bringing as his offering to the LORD one
unblemished yearling lamb for a holocaust, one unblemished yearling ewe lamb for a sin
offering, one unblemished ram as a peace offering, along with their cereal offerings and
libations, 15 and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and of unleavened
wafers spread with oil. 16 The priest shall present them before the LORD, and shall offer up the
sin offering and the holocaust for him. 17 He shall then offer up the ram as a peace offering to
Books of Moses

125

the LORD, with its cereal offering and libation, and the basket of unleavened cakes. 18 Then at
the entrance of the meeting tent the nazirite shall shave his dedicated head, collect the hair, and
put it in the fire that is under the peace offering. 19 After the nazirite has shaved off his dedicated
hair, the priest shall take a boiled shoulder of the ram, as well as one unleavened cake and one
unleavened wafer from the basket, and shall place them in the hands of the nazirite. 20 The priest
shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. They become sacred and shall belong
to the priest, along with the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the raised offering. Only
after this may the nazirite drink wine.
21 “This, then, is the law for the nazirite; this is the offering to the LORD which is included
in his vow of dedication apart from anything else which his means may allow. Thus shall he
carry out the law of his dedication in keeping with the vow he has taken.”
The Priestly Blessing. 22 The LORD said to Moses: 23 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and
tell them: This is how you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them: 24 The LORD bless you and
keep you! 25 The LORD let his face shine upon you, and be gracious to you! 26 The LORD look
upon you kindly and give you peace! 27 So shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites, and I
will bless them.”
Num. 7
Offerings of the Princes. 1 Now, when Moses had completed the erection of the Dwelling
and had anointed and consecrated it with all its equipment (as well as the altar with all its
equipment), 2 an offering was made by the princes of Israel, who were heads of ancestral houses;
the same princes of the tribes who supervised the census. 3 The offering they brought before the
LORD consisted of six baggage wagons and twelve oxen, that is, a wagon for every two princes,
and an ox for every prince. These they presented as their offering before the Dwelling.
4 The LORD then said to Moses, 5 “Accept their offering, that these things may be put to
use in the service of the meeting tent. Assign them to the Levites, to each group in proportion to
its duties.” 6 So Moses accepted the wagons and oxen, and assigned them to the Levites. 7 He
gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites in proportion to their duties, 8 and four
wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites in proportion to their duties, under the supervision of
Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. 9 He gave none to the Kohathites, because they had to carry on
their shoulders the sacred objects which were their charge.
10 For the dedication of the altar also, the princes brought offerings before the altar on the
day it was anointed. 11 But the LORD said to Moses, “Let one prince a day present his offering
for the dedication of the altar.”
12 The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon, son of Amminadab,
prince of the tribe of Judah. 13 His offering consisted of one silver plate weighing a hundred and
thirty shekels according to the sanctuary standard and one silver basin weighing seventy shekels,
both filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal offering; 14 one gold cup of ten shekels’
weight filled with incense; 15 one young bull, one ram, and one yearling lamb for a holocaust;
16 one goat for a sin offering; 17 and two oxen, five rams, five goats, and five yearling lambs for
a peace offering. This was the offering of Nahshon, son of Amminadab.
18 On the second day Nethanel, son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, made his offering. 19 He
presented as his offering one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels according to the
sanctuary standard and one silver basin weighing seventy shekels, both filled with fine flour
mixed with oil for a cereal offering; 20 one gold cup of ten shekels’ weight filled with incense;
21 one young bull, one ram, and one yearling lamb for a holocaust; 22 one goat for a sin
offering; 23 and two oxen, five rams, five goats, and five yearling lambs for a peace offering.
This was the offering of Nethanel, son of Zuar.
24 On the third day it was the turn of Eliab, son of Helon, prince of the Zebulunites. 25 His
offering consisted of one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels according to the
Books of Moses

The Voice. 89 When Moses entered the meeting tent to speak with him, he heard the voice
addressing him from above the propitiatory on the ark of the commandments, from between the
two cherubim; and it spoke to him….
Num. 8
The Lamps Set Up. 1 The LORD spoke to Moses, and said, 2 “Give Aaron this command:
When you set up the seven lamps, have them throw their light toward the front of the
lampstand.” 3 Aaron did so, setting up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, just
as the LORD had commanded Moses. 4 The lampstand was made of beaten gold in both its shaft
and its branches, according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses.
Purification of the Levites. 5 The LORD said to Moses: 6 “Take the Levites from among
the Israelites and purify them. 7 This is what you shall do to them to purify them. Sprinkle them
with the water of remission; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, and
so purify themselves. 8 They shall take a young bull, along with its cereal offering of fine flour
mixed with oil; you shall take another young bull for a sin offering. 9 Then have the Levites
come forward in front of the meeting tent, where you shall assemble also the whole community
of the Israelites. 10 While the Levites are present before the LORD, the Israelites shall lay their
hands upon them. 11 Let Aaron then offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from
the Israelites, thus devoting them to the service of the LORD. 12 The Levites in turn shall lay
their hands on the heads of the bullocks, which shall then be immolated, the one as a sin offering
and the other as a holocaust to the LORD, in atonement for the Levites. 13 Thus, then, shall you
Books of Moses

128

have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, to be offered as a wave offering to the LORD;
14 and thus shall you set aside the Levites from the rest of the Israelites, that they may be mine.
15 “Only then shall the Levites enter upon their service in the meeting tent. You shall purify
them and offer them as a wave offering; 16 because they, among the Israelites, are strictly
dedicated to me; I have taken them for myself in place of every first-born that opens the womb
among the Israelites. 17 Indeed, all the first-born among the Israelites, both of man and of beast,
belong to me; I consecrated them to myself on the day I slew all the first-born in the land of
Egypt. 18 But in place of all the first-born Israelites I have taken the Levites; 19 and I have given
these dedicated Israelites to Aaron and his sons to discharge the duties of the Israelites in the
meeting tent and to make atonement for them, so that no plague may strike among the Israelites
should they come near the sanctuary.”
20 Thus, then, did Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites deal with the
Levites, carrying out exactly the command which the LORD had given Moses concerning them.
21 When the Levites had cleansed themselves of sin and washed their clothes, Aaron offered
them as a wave offering before the LORD, and made atonement for them to purify them. 22
Only then did they enter upon their service in the meeting tent under the supervision of Aaron
and his sons. The command which the LORD had given Moses concerning the Levites was
carried out.
Age Limits for Levitical Service. 23 The LORD said to Moses: 24 “This is the rule for the
Levites. Each from his twenty-fifth year onward shall perform the required service in the
meeting tent. 25 When he is fifty years old, he shall retire from the required service and work no
longer. 26 His service with his fellow Levites shall consist in sharing their responsibilities in the
meeting tent, but he shall not do the work. This, then, is how you are to regulate the duties of the
Levites.”
Num. 9
Second Passover. 1 In the first month of the year following their departure from the land of
Egypt, the Lord said to Moses in the desert of Sinai, 2 “Tell the Israelites to celebrate the
Passover at the prescribed time. 3 The evening twilight of the fourteenth day of this month is the
prescribed time when you shall celebrate it, observing all its rules and regulations.” 4 Moses,
therefore, told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover. 5 And they did so, celebrating the Passover
in the desert of Sinai during the evening twilight of the fourteenth day of the first month, just as
the LORD had commanded Moses.
6 There were some, however, who were unclean because of a human corpse and so could
not keep the Passover that day. These men came up to Moses and Aaron that same day 7 and
said, “Although we are unclean because of a corpse, why should we be deprived of presenting
the LORD’S offering at its proper time along with the other Israelites?” 8 Moses answered them,
“Wait until I learn what the LORD will command in your regard.”
9 The LORD then said to Moses: 10 “Speak to the Israelites and say: If any one of you or of
your descendants is unclean because of a corpse, or if he is absent on a journey, he may still keep
the LORD’S Passover. 11 But he shall keep it in the second month, during the evening twilight
of the fourteenth day of that month, eating it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, 12 and not
leaving any of it over till morning, nor breaking any of its bones, but observing all the rules of
the Passover. 13 However, anyone who is clean and not away on a journey, who yet fails to keep
the Passover, shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’S offering at
the prescribed time. That man shall bear the consequences of his sin.
14 “If an alien who lives among you wishes to keep the LORD’S Passover, he too shall
observe the rules and regulations for the Passover. You shall have the same law for the resident
alien as for the native of the land.”
The Fiery Cloud. 15 On the day when the Dwelling was erected, the cloud covered the
Books of Moses

129

Dwelling, the tent of the commandments; but from evening until morning it took on the
appearance of fire over the Dwelling. 16 It was always so: during the day the Dwelling was
covered by the cloud, which at night had the appearance of fire. 17 Whenever the cloud rose
from the tent, the Israelites would break camp; wherever the cloud came to rest, they would pitch
camp. 18 At the bidding of the LORD the Israelites moved on, and at his bidding they encamped.
As long as the cloud stayed over the Dwelling, they remained in camp.
19 Even when the cloud tarried many days over the Dwelling, the Israelites obeyed the
LORD and would not move on; 20 yet sometimes the cloud was over the Dwelling only for a
few days. It was at the bidding of the LORD that they stayed in camp, and it was at his bidding
that they departed. 21 Sometimes the cloud remained there only from evening until morning; and
when it rose in the morning, they would depart. Or if the cloud lifted during the day, or even at
night, they would then set out. 22 Whether the cloud tarried over the Dwelling for two days or
for a month or longer, the Israelites remained in camp and did not depart; but when it lifted, they
moved on. 23 Thus, it was always at the bidding of the LORD that they encamped, and at his
bidding that they set out; ever heeding the charge of the LORD, as he had bidden them through
Moses.
Num. 10
The Silver Trumpets. 1 The LORD said to Moses: 2 “Make two trumpets of beaten silver,
which you shall use in assembling the community and in breaking camp. 3 When both are blown,
the whole community shall gather round you at the entrance of the meeting tent; 4 but when one
of them is blown, only the princes, the chiefs of the troops of Israel, shall gather round you. 5
When you sound the first alarm, those encamped on the east side shall set out; 6 when you sound
the second alarm, those encamped on the south side shall set out; when you sound the third
alarm, those encamped on the west side shall set out; when you sound the fourth alarm, those
encamped on the north side shall set out. Thus shall the alarm be sounded for them to depart. 7
But in calling forth an assembly you are to blow an ordinary blast, without sounding the alarm.
8 “It is the sons of Aaron, the priests, who shall blow the trumpets; and the use of them is
prescribed by perpetual statute for you and your descendants. 9 When in your own land you go to
war against an enemy that is attacking you, you shall sound the alarm on the trumpets, and the
LORD, your God, will remember you and save you from your foes. 10 On your days of
celebration, your festivals, and your new-moon feasts, you shall blow the trumpets over your
holocausts and your peace offerings; this will serve as a reminder of you before your God. I, the
LORD, am your God.”
II. FROM SINAI TO THE PLAINS OF MOAB
Departure from Sinai. 11 In the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month,
the cloud rose from the Dwelling of the commandments. 12 The Israelites moved on from the
desert of Sinai by stages, until the cloud came to rest in the desert of Paran.
13 The first time that they broke camp at the bidding of the LORD through Moses, 14 the
camp of the Judahites, under its own standard and arranged in companies, was the first to set out.
Nahshon, son of Amminadab, was over their host, 15 and Nethanel, son of Zuar, over the host of
the tribe of Issachar, 16 and Eliab, son of Helon, over the host of the tribe of Zebulun. 17 Then,
after the Dwelling was dismantled, the clans of Gershon and Merari set out, carrying the
Dwelling. 18 The camp of the Reubenites, under its own standard and arranged in companies,
was the next to set out, with Elizur, son of Shedeur, over their host, 19 and Shelumiel, son of
Zurishaddai, over the host of the tribe of Simeon, 20 and Eliasaph, son of Reuel, over the host of
the tribe of Gad. 21 The clan of Kohath then set out, carrying the sacred objects for the Dwelling,
which was to be erected before their arrival. 22 The camp of the Ephraimites next set out, under
Books of Moses

130

its own standard and arranged in companies, with Elishama, son of Ammihud, over their host, 23
and Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, over the host of the tribe of Manasseh, 24 and Abidan, son of
Gideoni, over the host of the tribe of Benjamin. 25 Finally, as rear guard for all the camps, the
camp of the Danites set out, under its own standard and arranged in companies, with Ahiezer,
son of Ammishaddai, over their host, 26 and Pagiel, son of Ochran, over the host of the tribe of
Asher, 27 and Ahira, son of Enan, over the host of the tribe of Naphtali. 28 This was the order of
departure for the Israelites, company by company.
Hobab as Guide. As they were setting out, 29 Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab, son
of Reuel the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place which the LORD has promised to give
us. Come with us, and we will be generous toward you, for the LORD has promised prosperity to
Israel.” 30 But he answered, “No, I will not come. I am going instead to my own country and to
my own kindred.” 31 Moses said, “Please, do not leave us; you know where we can camp in the
desert, and you will serve as eyes for us. 32 If you come with us, we will share with you the
prosperity the LORD will bestow on us.”
Into the Desert. 33 They moved on from the mountain of the LORD, a three days’ journey,
and the ark of the covenant of the LORD which was to seek out their resting place went the three
days’ journey with them. 34 And when they set out from camp, the cloud of the LORD was over
them by day.
35 Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, “Arise, O LORD, that your enemies may be
scattered, and those who hate you may flee before you.”36 And when it came to rest, he would
say, “Return, O LORD, you who ride upon the clouds, to the troops of Israel.”
Num. 11
Discontent of the People. 1 Now the people complained in the hearing of the LORD; and
when he heard it his wrath flared up so that the fire of the LORD burned among them and
consumed the outskirts of the camp. 2 But when the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the
LORD and the fire died out. 3 Hence that place was called Taberah, because there the fire of the
LORD burned among them.
4 The foreign elements among them were so greedy for meat that even the Israelites
lamented again, “Would that we had meat for food! 5 We remember the fish we used to eat
without cost in Egypt, and the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. 6 But
now we are famished; we see nothing before us but this manna.”
7 Manna was like coriander seed and had the appearance of bdellium. 8 When they had gone
about and gathered it up, the people would grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar,
then cook it in a pot and make it into loaves, which tasted like cakes made with oil. 9 At night,
when the dew fell upon the camp, the manna also fell.
10 When Moses heard the people, family after family, crying at the entrance of their tents,
so that the LORD became very angry, he was grieved. 11 “Why do you treat your servant so
badly?” Moses asked the LORD. “Why are you so displeased with me that you burden me with
all this people? 12 Was it I who conceived all this people? or was it I who gave them birth, that
you tell me to carry them at my bosom, like a foster father carrying an infant, to the land you
have promised under oath to their fathers? 13 Where can I get meat to give to all this people? For
they are crying to me, ‘Give us meat for our food.’ 14 I cannot carry all this people by myself,
for they are too heavy for me. 15 If this is the way you will deal with me, then please do me the
favor of killing me at once, so that I need no longer face this distress.”
The Seventy Elders. 16 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Assemble for me seventy of the
elders of Israel, men you know for true elders and authorities among the people, and bring them
to the meeting tent. When they are in place beside you, 17 I will come down and speak with you
there. I will also take some of the spirit that is on you and will bestow it on them, that they may
share the burden of the people with you. You will then not have to bear it by yourself.
Books of Moses

131

18 “To the people, however, you shall say: Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, when you
shall have meat to eat. For in the hearing of the LORD you have cried, ‘Would that we had meat
for food! Oh, how well off we were in Egypt!’ Therefore the LORD will give you meat for food,
19 and you will eat it, not for one day, or two days, or five, or ten, or twenty days, 20 but for a
whole month - until it comes out of your very nostrils and becomes loathsome to you. For you
have spurned the LORD who is in your midst, and in his presence you have wailed, ‘Why did we
ever leave Egypt?’”
21 But Moses said, “The people around me include six hundred thousand soldiers; yet you
say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month.’ 22 Can enough sheep and cattle be
slaughtered for them? If all the fish of the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”
23 The LORD answered Moses, “Is this beyond the LORD’S reach? You shall see now whether
or not what I have promised you takes place.”
The Spirit on the Elders. 24 So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had
said. Gathering seventy elders of the people, he had them stand around the tent. 25 The LORD
then came down in the cloud and spoke to him. Taking some of the spirit that was on Moses, he
bestowed it on the seventy elders; and as the spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied.
26 Now two men, one named Eldad and the other Medad, were not in the gathering but had
been left in the camp. They too had been on the list, but had not gone out to the tent; yet the spirit
came to rest on them also, and they prophesied in the camp. 27 So, when a young man quickly
told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp,” 28 Joshua, son of Nun, who from
his youth had been Moses’ aide, said, “Moses, my lord, stop them.” 29 But Moses answered him,
“Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the people of the LORD were prophets! Would
that the LORD might bestow his spirit on them all!” 30 Then Moses retired to the camp, along
with the elders of Israel.
The Quail. 31 There arose a wind sent by the LORD, that drove in quail from the sea and
brought them down over the camp site at a height of two cubits from the ground for the distance
of a day’s journey all around the camp. 32 All that day, all night, and all the next day the people
gathered in the quail. Even the one who got the least gathered ten homers of them. Then they
spread them out all around the camp. 33 But while the meat was still between their teeth, before
it could be consumed, the LORD’S wrath flared up against the people, and he struck them with a
very great plague. 34 So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah, because it was there that the
greedy people were buried.
35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth.
Num. 12
Jealousy of Aaron & Miriam. 1 While they were in Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke
against Moses on the pretext of the marriage he had contracted with a Cushite woman. 2 They
complained, “Is it through Moses alone that the LORD speaks? Does he not speak through us
also?” And the LORD heard this. 3 Now, Moses himself was by far the meekest man on the face
of the earth. 4 So at once the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three,
to the meeting tent.” And the three of them went. 5 Then the LORD came down in the column of
cloud, and standing at the entrance of the tent, called Aaron and Miriam. When both came
forward, 6 he said, “Now listen to the words of the LORD: Should there be a prophet among
you, in visions will I reveal myself to him, in dreams will I speak to him; 7 Not so with my
servant Moses! Throughout my house he bears my trust: 8 face to face I speak to him, plainly
and not in riddles. The presence of the LORD he beholds. Why, then, did you not fear to speak
against my servant Moses?”
Miriam’s Leprosy. 9 So angry was the LORD against them that when he departed, 10 and
the cloud withdrew from the tent, there was Miriam, a snow-white leper! When Aaron turned
and saw her a leper, 11 “Ah, my lord!” he said to Moses, “please do not charge us with the sin
Books of Moses

132

that we have foolishly committed! 12 Let her not thus be like the stillborn babe that comes forth
from its mother’s womb with its flesh half consumed.” 13 Then Moses cried to the LORD,
“Please, not this! Pray, heal her!” 14 But the LORD answered Moses, “Suppose her father had
spit in her face, would she not hide in shame for seven days? Let her be confined outside the
camp for seven days; only then may she be brought back.” 15 So Miriam was confined outside
the camp for seven days, and the people did not start out again until she was brought back.
16 After that the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the desert of Paran.
Num. 13
The Twelve Scouts. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Send men to reconnoiter the land of
Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. You shall send one man from each ancestral tribe, all
of them princes.” 3 So Moses dispatched them from the desert of Paran, as the LORD had
ordered. All of them were leaders among the Israelites; 4 by name they were:
Shammua, son of Zaccur, of the tribe of Reuben; 5 Shaphat, son of Hori, of the tribe of
Simeon; 6 Caleb, son of Jephunneh, of the tribe of Judah; 7 Igal (son of Joseph), of the tribe of
Issachar; 10 Gaddiel, son of Sodi, of the tribe of Zebulun; 11 Gaddi, son of Susi, of the tribe of
Manasseh, for the Josephites, with 8 Hoshea, son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim; 9 Palti, son of
Raphu, of the tribe of Benjamin; 12 Ammiel, son of Gemalli, of the tribe of Dan; 13 Sethur, son
of Michael, of the tribe of Asher; 14 Nahbi, son of Vophsi, of the tribe of Naphtali; 15 Geuel,
son of Machi, of the tribe of Gad. 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent out to
reconnoiter the land. But Hoshea, son of Nun, Moses called Joshua.
17 In sending them to reconnoiter the land of Canaan, Moses said to them, “Go up here in
the Negeb, up into the highlands, 18 and see what kind of land it is. Are the people living there
strong or weak, few or many? 19 Is the country in which they live good or bad? Are the towns in
which they dwell open or fortified? 20 Is the soil fertile or barren, wooded or clear? And do your
best to get some of the fruit of the land.” It was then the season for early grapes.
21 So they went up and reconnoitered the land from the desert of Zin as far as where Rehob
adjoins Labo of Hamath. 22 Going up by way of the Negeb, they reached Hebron, where
Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, descendants of the Anakim, were living. (Hebron had been built
seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23 They also reached the Wadi Eshcol, where they cut down
a branch with a single cluster of grapes on it, which two of them carried on a pole, as well as
some pomegranates and figs. 24 It was because of the cluster the Israelites cut there that they
called the place Wadi Eshcol.
Their Return. 25 After reconnoitering the land for forty days they returned, 26 met Moses
and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites in the desert of Paran at Kadesh, made a
report to them all, and showed them the fruit of the country. 27 They told Moses: “We went into
the land to which you sent us. It does indeed flow with milk and honey, and here is its fruit. 28
However, the people who are living in the land are fierce, and the towns are fortified and very
strong. Besides, we saw descendants of the Anakim there. 29 Amalekites live in the region of the
Negeb; Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites dwell in the highlands, and Canaanites along the
seacoast and the banks of the Jordan.”
30 Caleb, however, to quiet the people toward Moses, said, “We ought to go up and seize
the land, for we can certainly do so.” 31 But the men who had gone up with him said, “We
cannot attack these people; they are too strong for us.” 32 So they spread discouraging reports
among the Israelites about the land they had scouted, saying, “The land that we explored is a
country that consumes its inhabitants. And all the people we saw there are huge men, 33
veritable giants (the Anakim were a race of giants); we felt like mere grasshoppers, and so we
must have seemed to them.”

Num. 14
Threats of Revolt. 1 At this, the whole community broke out with loud cries, and even in
the night the people wailed. 2 All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, the whole
community saying to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that here in the
desert we were dead! 3 Why is the LORD bringing us into this land only to have us fall by the
sword? Our wives and little ones will be taken as booty. Would it not be better for us to return to
Egypt?” 4 So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and go back to Egypt.”
5 But Moses and Aaron fell prostrate before the whole assembled community of the
Israelites; 6 while Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who had been in the party
that scouted the land, tore their garments 7 and said to the whole community of the Israelites,
“The country which we went through and explored is a fine, rich land. 8 If the LORD is pleased
with us, he will bring us in and give us that land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 9 But do
not rebel against the LORD! You need not be afraid of the people of that land; they are but food
for us! Their defense has left them, but the LORD is with us. Therefore, do not be afraid of
them.” 10 In answer, the whole community threatened to stone them.
But then the glory of the LORD appeared at the meeting tent to all the Israelites. 11 And the
LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people spurn me? How long will they refuse to
believe in me, despite all the signs I have performed among them? 12 I will strike them with
pestilence and wipe them out. Then I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”
13 But Moses said to the LORD: “Are the Egyptians to hear of this? For by your power you
brought out this people from among them. 14 And are they to tell of it to the inhabitants of this
land? It has been heard that you, O LORD, are in the midst of this people; you, LORD, who
plainly reveal yourself! Your cloud stands over them, and you go before them by day in a
column of cloud and by night in a column of fire. 15 If now you slay this whole people, the
nations who have heard such reports of you will say, 16 ‘The LORD was not able to bring this
people into the land he swore to give them; that is why he slaughtered them in the desert.’ 17
Now then, let the power of my Lord be displayed in its greatness, even as you have said, 18 ‘The
LORD is slow to anger and rich in kindness, forgiving wickedness and crime; yet not declaring
the guilty guiltless, but punishing children to the third and fourth generation for their fathers’
wickedness.’ 19 Pardon, then, the wickedness of this people in keeping with your great kindness,
even as you have forgiven them from Egypt until now.”
20 The LORD answered: “I pardon them as you have asked. 21 Yet, by my life and the
LORD’S glory that fills the whole earth, 22 of all the men who have seen my glory and the signs
I worked in Egypt and in the desert, and who nevertheless have put me to the test ten times
already and have failed to heed my voice, 23 not one shall see the land which I promised on oath
to their fathers. None of these who have spurned me shall see it. 24 But because my servant
Caleb has a different spirit and follows me unreservedly, I will bring him into the land where he
has just been, and his descendants shall possess it. 25 But now, since the Amalekites and
Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn away tomorrow and set out in the desert on the Red Sea
road.”
26 The LORD also said to Moses and Aaron: 27 “How long will this wicked community
grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the Israelites against me. 28 Tell them: By
my life, says the LORD, I will do to you just what I have heard you say. 29 Here in the desert
shall your dead bodies fall. Of all your men of twenty years or more, registered in the census,
who grumbled against me, 30 not one shall enter the land where I solemnly swore to settle you,
except Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun. 31 Your little ones, however, who you
said would be taken as booty, I will bring in, and they shall appreciate the land you spurned. 32
But as for you, your bodies shall fall here in the desert, 33 here where your children must wander
for forty years, suffering for your faithlessness, till the last of you lies dead in the desert. 34
Forty days you spent in scouting the land; forty years shall you suffer for your crimes: one year

for each day. Thus you will realize what it means to oppose me. 35 I, the LORD, have sworn to
do this to all this wicked community that conspired against me: here in the desert they shall die
to the last man.”
36 And so it happened to the men whom Moses had sent to reconnoiter the land and who on
returning had set the whole community grumbling against him by spreading discouraging reports
about the land; 37 these men who had given out the bad report about the land were struck down
by the LORD and died. 38 Of all the men who had gone to reconnoiter the land, only Joshua, son
of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, survived.
Unsuccessful Invasion. 39 When Moses repeated these words to all the Israelites, the
people felt great remorse. 40 Early the next morning they started up into the foothills, saying,
“Here we are, ready to go up to the place that the LORD spoke of: for we were indeed doing
wrong.” 41 But Moses said, “Why are you again disobeying the LORD’S orders? This cannot
succeed. 42 Do not go up, because the LORD is not in your midst; if you go, you will be beaten
down before your enemies. 43 For there the Amalekites and Canaanites face you, and you will
fall by the sword. You have turned back from following the LORD; therefore the LORD will not
be with you.”
44 Yet they dared to go up into the foothills, even though neither the ark of the covenant of
the LORD nor Moses left the camp. 45 And the Amalekites and Canaanites who dwelt in that hill
country came down and defeated them, beating them back as far as Hormah.
Num. 15
Secondary Offerings. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Give the Israelites these instructions:
When you have entered the land that I will give you for your homesteads, 3 if you make to the
LORD a sweet-smelling oblation from the herd or from the flock, in holocaust, in fulfillment of a
vow, or as a freewill offering, or for one of your festivals, 4 whoever does so shall also present to
the LORD a cereal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of
a hin of oil, 5 as well as a libation of a fourth of a hin of wine, with each lamb sacrificed in
holocaust or otherwise. 6 With each sacrifice of a ram you shall present a cereal offering of two
tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, 7 and a libation of a third of a
hin of wine, thus making a sweet-smelling offering to the LORD. 8 When you sacrifice an ox as
a holocaust, or in fulfillment of a vow, or as a peace offering to the LORD, 9 with it you shall
present a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil, 10
and a libation of half a hin of wine, as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 11 The same is to
be done for each ox, ram, lamb or goat. 12 Whatever the number you offer, do the same for each
of them.
13 “All the native-born shall make these offerings in the same way, whenever they present a
sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. 14 Likewise, in any future generation, any alien residing
with you permanently or for a time, who presents a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD, shall
do as you do. 15 There is but one rule for you and for the resident alien, a perpetual rule for all
your descendants. Before the LORD you and the alien are alike, 16 with the same law and the
same application of it for the alien residing among you as for yourselves.”
17 The LORD said to Moses, 18 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the
land into which I will bring you 19 and begin to eat of the food of that land, you shall offer the
LORD a contribution 20 consisting of a cake of your first batch of dough. You shall offer it just
as you offer a contribution from the threshing floor. 21 Throughout your generations you shall
give a contribution to the LORD from your first batch of dough.
Sin Offerings. 22 “When through inadvertence you fail to carry out any of these
commandments which the LORD gives to Moses, 23 and through Moses to you, from the time
the LORD first issues the commandment down through your generations: 24 if the community
itself unwittingly becomes guilty of the fault of inadvertence, the whole community shall offer
Books of Moses

135

the holocaust of one young bull as a sweet-smelling oblation pleasing to the LORD, along with
its prescribed cereal offering and libation, as well as one he-goat as a sin offering. 25 Then the
priest shall make atonement for the whole Israelite community; thus they will be forgiven the
inadvertence for which they have brought their holocaust as an oblation to the LORD. 26 Not
only the whole Israelite community, but also the aliens residing among you, shall be forgiven,
since the fault of inadvertence affects all the people.
27 “However, if it is an individual who sins inadvertently, he shall bring a yearling she-goat
as a sin offering, 28 and the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for him who sinned
inadvertently; when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven. 29 You shall have
but one law for him who sins inadvertently, whether he be a native Israelite or an alien residing
with you.
30 “But anyone who sins defiantly, whether he be a native or an alien, insults the LORD,
and shall be cut off from among his people. 31 Since he has despised the word of the LORD and
has broken his commandment, he must be cut off. He has only himself to blame.”
The Sabbath-breaker. 32 While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was discovered
gathering wood on the sabbath day. 33 Those who caught him at it brought him to Moses and
Aaron and the whole assembly. 34 But they kept him in custody, for there was no clear decision
as to what should be done with him. 35 Then the LORD said to Moses, “This man shall be put to
death; let the whole community stone him outside the camp.” 36 So the whole community led
him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Tassels on the Cloak. 37 The LORD said to Moses, 38 “Speak to the Israelites and tell
them that they and their descendants must put tassels on the corners of their garments, fastening
each corner tassel with a violet cord. 39 When you use these tassels, let the sight of them remind
you to keep all the commandments of the LORD, without going wantonly astray after the desires
of your hearts and eyes. 40 Thus you will remember to keep all my commandments and be holy
to your God. 41 I, the LORD, am your God who, as God, brought you out of Egypt that I, the
LORD, may be your God.”
Num. 16
Rebellion of Korah. 1 Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, (and Dathan and
Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Pallu, son of Reuben) took 2 two hundred and fifty Israelites who
were leaders in the community, members of the council and men of note. They stood before
Moses, 3 and held an assembly against Moses and Aaron, to whom they said, “Enough from
you! The whole community, all of them, are holy; the LORD is in their midst. Why then should
you set yourselves over the LORD’S congregation?”
4 When Moses heard this, he fell prostrate. 5 Then he said to Korah and to all his band,
“May the LORD make known tomorrow morning who belongs to him and who is the holy one
and whom he will have draw near to him! Whom he chooses, he will have draw near him. 6 Do
this: take your censers (Korah and all his band) 7 and put fire in them and place incense in them
before the LORD tomorrow. He whom the LORD then chooses is the holy one. Enough from
you Levites!”
8 Moses also said to Korah, “Listen to me, you Levites! 9 Is it too little for you that the God
of Israel has singled you out from the community of Israel, to have you draw near him for the
service of the LORD’S Dwelling and to stand before the community to minister for them? 10 He
has allowed you and your kinsmen, the descendants of Levi, to approach him, and yet you now
seek the priesthood too. 11 It is therefore against the LORD that you and all your band are
conspiring. For what has Aaron done that you should grumble against him?”
Rebellion of Dathan and Abiram. 12 Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab,
but they answered, “We will not go. 13 Are you not satisfied with having led us here away from
a land flowing with milk and honey, to make us perish in the desert, that you must now lord it
Books of Moses

136

over us? 14 Far from bringing us to a land flowing with milk and honey, or giving us fields and
vineyards for our inheritance, will you also gouge out our eyes? No, we will not go.”
15 Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Pay no heed to their offering. I
have never taken a single ass from them, nor have I wronged any one of them.”
Korah. 16 Moses said to Korah, “You and all your band shall appear before the LORD
tomorrow - you and they and Aaron too. 17 Then each of your two hundred and fifty followers
shall take his own censer, put incense in it, and offer it to the LORD; and you and Aaron, each
with his own censer, shall do the same.” 18 So they all took their censers, and laying incense on
the fire they had put in them, they took their stand by the entrance of the meeting tent along with
Moses and Aaron. 19 Then, when Korah had assembled all his band against them at the entrance
of the meeting tent, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire community, 20 and the LORD
said to Moses and Aaron, 21 “Stand apart from this band, that I may consume them at once.” 22
But they fell prostrate and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will one man’s
sin make you angry with the whole community?” 23 The LORD answered Moses, 24 “Speak to
the community and tell them: Withdraw from the space around the Dwelling” (of Korah, Dathan
and Abiram).
Punishment of Dathan and Abiram. 25 Moses, followed by the elders of Israel, arose and
went to Dathan and Abiram. 26 Then he warned the community, “Keep away from the tents of
these wicked men and do not touch anything that is theirs: otherwise you too will be swept away
because of all their sins.” 27 When Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at the
entrances of their tents with their wives and sons and little ones, 28 Moses said, “This is how you
shall know that it was the LORD who sent me to do all I have done, and that it was not I who
planned it: 29 if these men die an ordinary death, merely suffering the fate common to all
mankind, then it was not the LORD who sent me. 30 But if the LORD does something entirely
new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them alive down into the nether world, with
all belonging to them, then you will know that these men have defied the LORD.” 31 No sooner
had he finished saying all this than the ground beneath them split open, 32 and the earth opened
its mouth and swallowed them and their families (and all of Korah’s men) and all their
possessions. 33 They went down alive to the nether world with all belonging to them; the earth
closed over them, and they perished from the community. 34 But all the Israelites near them fled
at their shrieks, saying, “The earth might swallow us too!”
Punishment of Korah. 35 So they withdrew from the space around the Dwelling (of
Korah, Dathan and Abiram). And fire from the LORD came forth which consumed the two
hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.
Num. 17
1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, to remove the censers
from the embers; and scatter the fire some distance away, 3 for these sinners have consecrated
the censers at the cost of their lives. Have them hammered into plates to cover the altar, because
in being presented before the LORD they have become sacred. In this way they shall serve as a
sign to the Israelites.” 4 So Eleazar the priest had the bronze censers of those burned during the
offering hammered into a covering for the altar, 5 in keeping with the orders which the LORD
had given him through Moses. This cover was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no layman,
no one who was not a descendant of Aaron, should approach the altar to offer incense before the
LORD, lest he meet the fate of Korah and his band.
6 The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying,
“It is you who have slain the LORD’S people.” 7 But while the community was deliberating
against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the meeting tent, and the cloud now covered it and
the glory of the LORD appeared. 8 Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the meeting tent,
9 and the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 10 “Depart from this community, that I may consume
Books of Moses

137

them at once.” But they fell prostrate.
11 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on
it, and bring it quickly to the community to make atonement for them; for wrath has come forth
from the LORD and the blow is falling.” 12 Obeying the orders of Moses, Aaron took his censer
and ran in among the community, where the blow was already falling on the people. Then, as he
offered the incense and made atonement for the people, 13 standing there between the living and
the dead, the scourge was checked. 14 Yet fourteen thousand seven hundred died from the
scourge, in addition to those who died because of Korah. 15 When the scourge had been
checked, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the meeting tent.
Aaron’s Staff. 16 The LORD now said to Moses, 17 “Speak to the Israelites and get one
staff from them for each ancestral house, twelve staffs in all, one from each of their tribal
princes. Mark each man’s name on his staff; 18 and mark Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, for the
head of Levi’s ancestral house shall also have a staff. 19 Then lay them down in the meeting tent,
in front of the commandments, where I meet you. 20 There the staff of the man of my choice
shall sprout. Thus will I suppress from my presence the Israelites’ grumbling against you.”
21 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their princes gave him staffs, twelve in all, one
from each tribal prince; and Aaron’s staff was with them. 22 Then Moses laid the staffs down
before the LORD in the tent of the commandments. 23 The next day, when Moses entered the
tent, Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth not only shoots,
but blossoms as well, and even bore ripe almonds! 24 Moses thereupon brought out all the staffs
from the LORD’S presence to the Israelites. After each prince identified his own staff and took
it, 25 the LORD said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the commandments, to be kept
there as a warning to the rebellious, so that their grumbling may cease before me; if it does not,
they will die.” 26 And Moses did as the LORD had commanded him.
Charge of the Sacred Things. 27 Then the Israelites cried out to Moses, “We are
perishing; we are lost, we are all lost! 28 Every time anyone approaches the Dwelling of the
LORD, he dies! Are we to perish to the last man?”
Num. 18
1 The LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons as well as the other members of your
ancestral house shall be responsible for the sanctuary; but the responsibility of the priesthood
shall rest on you and your sons alone. 2 Bring with you also your other kinsmen of the tribe of
Levi, your ancestral tribe, as your associates and assistants, while you and your sons are in front
of the tent of the commandments. 3 They shall look after your persons and the whole tent;
however, they shall not come near the sacred vessels or the altar, lest both they and you die. 4 As
your associates they shall have charge of all the work connected with the meeting tent. But no
layman shall come near you. 5 You shall have charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, that wrath
may not fall again upon the Israelites.
6 “Remember, it is I who have taken your kinsmen, the Levites, from the body of the
Israelites; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD for the service of the meeting tent. 7 But
only you and your sons are to have charge of performing the priestly functions in whatever
concerns the altar and the room within the veil. I give you the priesthood as a gift. Any layman
who draws near shall be put to death.”
The Priests’ Share of the Sacrifices. 8 The LORD said to Aaron, “I myself have given you
charge of the contributions made to me in the various sacred offerings of the Israelites; by
perpetual ordinance I have assigned them to you and to your sons as your priestly share. 9 You
shall have the right to share in the oblations that are most sacred, in whatever they offer me as
cereal offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings; these shares shall accrue to you and to your
sons. 10 In eating them you shall treat them as most sacred; every male among you may partake
of them. As sacred, they belong to you.
Books of Moses

138

11 “You shall also have what is removed from the gift in every wave offering of the
Israelites; by perpetual ordinance I have assigned it to you and to your sons and daughters. All in
your family who are clean may partake of it. 12 I have also assigned to you all the best of the
new oil and of the new wine and grain that they give to the LORD as their first fruits; 13 and
likewise, of whatever grows on their land, the first products that they bring in to the LORD shall
be yours; all of your family who are clean may partake of them. 14 Whatever is doomed in Israel
shall be yours. 15 Every living thing that opens the womb, whether of man or of beast, such as
are to be offered to the LORD, shall be yours; but you must let the first-born of man, as well as
of unclean animals, be redeemed. 16 The ransom for a boy is to be paid when he is a month old;
it is fixed at five silver shekels according to the sanctuary standard, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
17 But the first-born of cattle, sheep or goats shall not be redeemed; they are sacred. Their blood
you must splash on the altar and their fat you must burn as a sweet-smelling oblation to the
LORD. 18 Their meat, however, shall be yours, just as the breast and the right leg of the wave
offering belong to you. 19 By perpetual ordinance I have assigned to you and to your sons and
daughters all the contributions from the sacred gifts which the Israelites make to the LORD; this
is an inviolable covenant to last forever before the LORD, for you and for your descendants.” 20
Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall not have any heritage in the land of the Israelites nor
hold any portion among them; I will be your portion and your heritage among them.
Tithes Due the Levites. 21 “To the Levites, however, I hereby assign all tithes in Israel as
their heritage in recompense for the service they perform in the meeting tent. 22 The Israelites
may no longer approach the meeting tent; else they will incur guilt deserving death. 23 Only the
Levites are to perform the service of the meeting tent, and they alone shall be held responsible;
this is a perpetual ordinance for all your generations. The Levites, therefore, shall not have any
heritage among the Israelites, 24 for I have assigned to them as their heritage the tithes which the
Israelites give as a contribution to the LORD. That is why I have ordered that they are not to
have any heritage among the Israelites.”
Tithes Paid by Levites. 25 The LORD said to Moses, 26 “Give the Levites these
instructions: When you receive from the Israelites the tithes I have assigned you from them as
your heritage, you are to make a contribution from them to the LORD, a tithe of the tithes; 27
and your contribution will be credited to you as if it were grain from the threshing floor or new
wine from the press. 28 Thus you too shall make a contribution from all the tithes you receive
from the Israelites, handing over to Aaron the priest the part to be contributed to the LORD. 29
From all the gifts that you receive, and from the best parts, you are to consecrate to the LORD
your own full contribution.
30 “Tell them also: Once you have made your contribution from the best part, the rest of the
tithes will be credited to you Levites as if it were produce of the threshing floor or of the
winepress. 31 Your families, as well as you, may eat them anywhere, since they are your
recompense for service at the meeting tent. 32 You will incur no guilt so long as you make a
contribution of the best part. Do not profane the sacred gifts of the Israelites and so bring death
on yourselves.”
Num. 19
Ashes of the Red Heifer. 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 2 “This is the regulation
which the law of the LORD prescribes. Tell the Israelites to procure for you a red heifer that is
free from every blemish and defect and on which no yoke has ever been laid. 3 This is to be
given to Eleazar the priest, to be led outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. 4 Eleazar
the priest shall take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of
the meeting tent. 5 Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight, with its hide and flesh, its blood
and offal; 6 and the priest shall take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet yarn and throw them
into the fire in which the heifer is being burned. 7 The priest shall then wash his garments and
Books of Moses

139

bathe his body in water. He remains unclean until the evening, and only afterward may he return
to the camp. 8 Likewise, he who burned the heifer shall wash his garments, bathe his body in
water, and be unclean until evening. 9 Finally, a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of
the heifer and deposit them in a clean place outside the camp. There they are to be kept for
preparing lustral water for the Israelite community. The heifer is a sin offering. 10 He who has
gathered up the ashes of the heifer shall also wash his garments and be unclean until evening.
This is a perpetual ordinance, both for the Israelites and for the aliens residing among them.
Use of the Ashes. 11 “Whoever touches the dead body of any human being shall be unclean
for seven days; 12 he shall purify himself with the water on the third and on the seventh day, and
then he will be clean again. But if he fails to purify himself on the third and on the seventh day,
he will not become clean. 13 Everyone who fails to purify himself after touching the body of any
deceased person, defiles the Dwelling of the LORD and shall be cut off from Israel. Since the
lustral water has not been splashed over him, he remains unclean: his uncleanness still clings to
him.
14 “This is the law: When a man dies in a tent, everyone who enters the tent, as well as
everyone already in it, shall be unclean for seven days; 15 likewise, every vessel that is open, or
with its lid unfastened, shall be unclean. 16 Moreover, everyone who in the open country touches
a dead person, whether he was slain by the sword or died naturally, or who touches a human
bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days. 17 For anyone who is thus unclean, ashes from
the sin offering shall be put in a vessel, and spring water shall be poured on them. 18 Then a man
who is clean shall take some hyssop, dip it in this water, and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the
vessels and persons that were in it, or on him who touched a bone, a slain person or other dead
body, or a grave. 19 The clean man shall sprinkle the unclean on the third and on the seventh
day; thus purified on the seventh day, he shall wash his garments and bathe his body in water,
and in the evening he will be clean again. 20 Any unclean man who fails to have himself purified
shall be cut off from the community, because he defiles the sanctuary of the LORD. As long as
the lustral water has not been splashed over him, he remains unclean. 21 This shall be a perpetual
ordinance for you.
“One who sprinkles the lustral water shall wash his garments, and anyone who comes in
contact with this water shall be unclean until evening. 22 Moreover, whatever the unclean person
touches becomes unclean itself, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean until evening.”
Num. 20
Death of Miriam. 1 The whole Israelite community arrived in the desert of Zin in the first
month, and the people settled at Kadesh. It was here that Miriam died, and here that she was
buried.
Water Famine at Kadesh. 2 As the community had no water, they held a council against
Moses and Aaron. 3 The people contended with Moses, exclaiming, “Would that we too had
perished with our kinsmen in the LORD’S presence! 4 Why have you brought the LORD’S
community into this desert where we and our livestock are dying? 5 Why did you lead us out of
Egypt, only to bring us to this wretched place which has neither grain nor figs nor vines nor
pomegranates? Here there is not even water to drink!” 6 But Moses and Aaron went away from
the assembly to the entrance of the meeting tent, where they fell prostrate.
Sin of Moses & Aaron. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them, 7 and the LORD
said to Moses, 8 “Take the staff and assemble the community, you and your brother Aaron, and
in their presence order the rock to yield its waters. From the rock you shall bring forth water for
the community and their livestock to drink.” 9 So Moses took the staff from its place before the
LORD, as he was ordered. 10 He and Aaron assembled the community in front of the rock,
where he said to them, “Listen to me, you rebels! Are we to bring water for you out of this
rock?” 11 Then, raising his hand, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water gushed

out in abundance for the community and their livestock to drink. 12 But the LORD said to Moses
and Aaron, “Because you were not faithful to me in showing forth my sanctity before the
Israelites, you shall not lead this community into the land I will give them.”
13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites contended against the LORD, and
where he revealed his sanctity among them.
Edom’s Refusal. 14 From Kadesh Moses sent men to the king of Edom with the message:
“Your brother Israel has this to say: You know of all the hardships that have befallen us, 15 how
our fathers went down to Egypt, where we stayed a long time, how the Egyptians maltreated us
and our fathers, 16 and how, when we cried to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel
who led us out of Egypt. Now here we are at the town of Kadesh at the edge of your territory. 17
Kindly let us pass through your country. We will not cross any fields or vineyards, nor drink any
well water, but we will go straight along the royal road without turning to the right or to the left,
until we have passed through your territory.”
18 But Edom answered him, “You shall not pass through here; if you do, I will advance
against you with the sword.” 19 The Israelites insisted, “We want only to go up along the
highway. If we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. Surely there is no
harm in merely letting us march through.” 20 But Edom still said, “No, you shall not pass
through,” and advanced against them with a large and heavily armed force. 21 Therefore, since
Edom refused to let them pass through their territory, Israel detoured around them.
Death of Aaron. 22 Setting out from Kadesh, the whole Israelite community came to
Mount Hor. 23 There at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses
and Aaron, 24 “Aaron is about to be taken to his people; he shall not enter the land I am giving to
the Israelites, because you both rebelled against my commandment at the waters of Meribah. 25
Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up on Mount Hor. 26 Then strip Aaron of his
garments and put them on his son Eleazar; for there Aaron shall be taken in death.”
27 Moses did as the LORD commanded. When they had climbed Mount Hor in view of the
whole community, 28 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar.
Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain. When Moses and Eleazar came down from the
mountain, 29 all the community understood that Aaron had passed away; and for thirty days the
whole house of Israel mourned him.

Victory Over Arad. 1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb, heard
that the Israelites were coming along the way of Atharim, he engaged them in battle and took
some of them captive. 2 Israel then made this vow to the LORD: “If you deliver this people into
my hand, I will doom their cities.” 3 Later, when the LORD heeded Israel’s prayer and delivered
up the Canaanites, they doomed them and their cities. Hence that place was named Hormah.
The Bronze Serpent. 4 From Mount Hor they set out on the Red Sea road, to by-pass the
land of Edom. But with their patience worn out by the journey, 5 the people complained against
God and Moses, “Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no
food or water? We are disgusted with this wretched food!”
6 In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents, which bit the people so
that many of them died. 7 Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned in
complaining against the LORD and you. Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us.” So Moses
prayed for the people, 8 and the LORD said to Moses, “Make a saraph and mount it on a pole,
and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover.” 9 Moses accordingly made a
bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole, and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent
looked at the bronze serpent, he recovered.
Journey Around Moab. 10 The Israelites moved on and encamped in Oboth. 11 Setting
out from Oboth, they encamped in Iye-abarim in the desert fronting Moab on the east. 12 Setting

out from there, they encamped in the Wadi Zered. 13 Setting out from there, they encamped on
the other side of the Arnon, in the desert that extends from the territory of the Amorites; for the
Arnon forms Moab’s boundary with the Amorites. 14 Hence it is said in the “Book of the Wars
of the LORD”: “Waheb in Suphah and the wadies, 15 Arnon and the wadi gorges That reach
back toward the site of Ar and slant to the border of Moab.”
16 From there they went to Beer, where there was the well of which the LORD said to
Moses, “Bring the people together, and I will give them water.” 17 Then it was that Israel sang
this song: “Spring up, O well!—so sing to it— 18 The well that the princes sank, that the nobles
of the people dug, with their scepters and their staffs.”
From Beer they went to Mattanah, 19 from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
20 from Bamoth to the cleft in the plateau of Moab at the headland of Pisgah that overlooks
Jeshimon.
Victory Over Sihon. 21 Now Israel sent men to Sihon, king of the Amorites, with the
message, 22 “Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard,
nor will we drink any well water, but we will go straight along the royal road until we have
passed through your territory.” 23 Sihon, however, would not let Israel pass through his territory,
but mustered all his forces and advanced into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz,
he engaged Israel in battle. 24 But Israel defeated him at the point of the sword, and took
possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and as far as the country of the Ammonites,
whose boundary was at Jazer. 25 Israel seized all the towns here and settled in these towns of the
Amorites, in Heshbon and all its dependencies. 26 Now Heshbon was the capital of Sihon, king
of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had seized all his land
from Jazer to the Arnon. 27 That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt,
let Sihon’s capital be firmly constructed. 28 For fire went forth from Heshbon and a blaze from
the city of Sihon; It consumed the cities of Moab and swallowed up the high places of the Arnon.
29 Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He let his sons become
fugitives and his daughters be taken captive by the Amorite king Sihon. 30 Their plowland is
ruined from Heshbon to Dibon; Ar is laid waste; fires blaze as far as Medeba.”
31 When Israel had settled in the land of the Amorites, 32 Moses sent spies to Jazer; Israel
then captured it with its dependencies and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
Victory Over Og. 33 Then they turned and went up along the road to Bashan. But Og, king
of Bashan, advanced against them with all his people to give battle at Edrei. 34 The LORD,
however, said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him; for into your hand I will deliver him with all
his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in
Heshbon.” 35 So they struck him down with his sons and all his people, until not a survivor was
left to him, and they took possession of his land.
Num. 22
1 Then the Israelites moved on and encamped in the plains of Moab on the other side of the
Jericho stretch of the Jordan.
III. ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB
Balaam Summoned. 2 Now Balak, son of Zippor, saw all that Israel did to the Amorites. 3
Indeed, Moab feared the Israelites greatly because of their numbers, and detested them. 4 So
Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Soon this horde will devour all the country around us as an
ox devours the grass of the field.” And Balak, Zippor’s son, who was king of Moab at that time,
5 sent messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, at Pethor on the Euphrates, in the land of the
Amawites, summoning him with these words, “A people has come here from Egypt who now
cover the face of the earth and are settling down opposite us! 6 Please come and curse this people

142

for us; they are stronger than we are. We may then be able to defeat them and drive them out of
the country. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed and whoever you curse is cursed.” 7
Then the elders of Moab and of Midian left with the divination fee in hand and went to Balaam.
When they had given him Balak’s message, 8 he said to them in reply, “Stay here overnight, and
I will give you whatever answer the LORD gives me.” So the princes of Moab lodged with
Balaam.
9 Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men visiting you?” 10 Balaam
answered God, “Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me the message: 11 ‘This people that
came here from Egypt now cover the face of the earth. Please come and lay a curse on them for
us; we may then be able to give them battle and drive them out.’” 12 But God said to Balaam,
“Do not go with them and do not curse this people, for they are blessed.” 13 The next morning
Balaam arose and told the princes of Balak, “Go back to your own country, for the LORD has
refused to let me go with you.” 14 So the princes of Moab went back to Balak with the report,
“Balaam refused to come with us.”
Second Appeal to Balaam. 15 Balak again sent princes, who were more numerous and
more distinguished than the others. 16 On coming to Balaam they told him, “This is what Balak,
son of Zippor, has to say: Please do not refuse to come to me. 17 I will reward you very
handsomely and will do anything you ask of me. Please come and lay a curse on this people for
me.” 18 But Balaam replied to Balak’s officials, “Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver
and gold, I could not do anything, small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD, my
God. 19 But, you too shall stay here overnight, till I learn what else the LORD may tell me.”
20 That night God came to Balaam and said to him, “If these men have come to summon
you, you may go with them; yet only on the condition that you do exactly as I tell you.” 21 So
the next morning when Balaam arose, he saddled his ass, and went off with the princes of Moab.
The Talking Ass. 22 But now the anger of God flared up at him for going, and the angel of
the LORD stationed himself on the road to hinder him as he was riding along on his ass,
accompanied by two of his servants. 23 When the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing on the
road with sword drawn, she turned off the road and went into the field, and Balaam had to beat
her to bring her back on the road. 24 Then the angel of the LORD took his stand in a narrow lane
between vineyards with a stone wall on each side. 25 When the ass saw the angel of the LORD
there, she shrank against the wall; and since she squeezed Balaam’s leg against it, he beat her
again. 26 The angel of the LORD then went ahead, and stopped next in a passage so narrow that
there was no room to move either to the right or to the left. 27 When the ass saw the angel of the
LORD there, she cowered under Balaam. So, in anger, he again beat the ass with his stick.
28 But now the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she asked Balaam, “What have I
done to you that you should beat me these three times?” 29 “You have acted so willfully against
me,” said Balaam to the ass, “that if I but had a sword at hand, I would kill you here and now.”
30 But the ass said to Balaam, “Am I not your own beast, and have you not always ridden upon
me until now? Have I been in the habit of treating you this way before?” “No,” replied Balaam.
31 Then the LORD removed the veil from Balaam’s eyes, so that he too saw the angel of the
LORD standing on the road with sword drawn; and he fell on his knees and bowed to the ground.
32 But the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you beaten your ass these three times? It
is I who have come armed to hinder you because this rash journey of yours is directly opposed to
me. 33 When the ass saw me, she turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned
away from me, I would have killed you; her I would have spared.” 34 Then Balaam said to the
angel of the LORD, “I have sinned. Yet I did not know that you stood against me to oppose my
journey. Since it has displeased you, I will go back home.” 35 But the angel of the LORD said to
Balaam, “Go with the men; but you may say only what I tell you.” So Balaam went on with the
princes of Balak.
36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the boundary
Books of Moses

143

city Ir-Moab on the Arnon at the end of the Moabite territory. 37 And he said to Balaam, “I sent
an urgent summons to you! Why did you not come to me? Did you think I could not reward
you?” 38 Balaam answered him, “Well, I have come to you after all. But what power have I to
say anything? I can speak only what God puts in my mouth.” 39 Then Balaam went with Balak,
and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 40 Here Balak slaughtered oxen and sheep, and sent portions to
Balaam and to the princes who were with him.
The First Oracle. 41 The next morning Balak took Balaam up on Bamoth-baal, and from
there he saw some of the clans.
Num. 23
1 Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars, and prepare seven bullocks and seven
rams for me here.” 2 So he did as Balaam had ordered, offering a bullock and a ram on each
altar. And Balak said to him, “I have erected the seven altars, and have offered a bullock and a
ram on each.” 3 Balaam then said to him, “Stand here by your holocaust while I go over there.
Perhaps the LORD will meet me, and then I will tell you whatever he lets me see.” He went out
on the barren height, 4 and God met him. 5 When he had put an utterance in Balaam’s mouth, the
LORD said to him, “Go back to Balak, and speak accordingly.” 6 So he went back to Balak, who
was still standing by his holocaust together with all the princes of Moab. 7 Then Balaam gave
voice to his oracle: “From Aram has Balak brought me here, Moab’s king, from the Eastern
Mountains: ‘Come and lay a curse for me on Jacob, come and denounce Israel.’ 8 How can I
curse whom God has not cursed? How denounce whom the LORD has not denounced? 9 For
from the top of the crags I see him, from the heights I behold him. Here is a people that lives
apart and does not reckon itself among the nations. 10 Who has ever counted the dust of Jacob,
or numbered Israel’s wind-borne particles? May I die the death of the just, may my descendants
be as many as theirs!”
11 “What have you done to me?” cried Balak to Balaam. “It was to curse my foes that I
brought you here; instead, you have even blessed them.” 12 Balaam replied, “Is it not what the
LORD puts in my mouth that I must repeat with care?”
The Second Oracle. 13 Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place
from which you can see only some and not all of them, and from there curse them for me.” 14 So
he brought him to the lookout field on the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a
bullock and a ram on each of them. 15 Balaam then said to Balak, “Stand here by your holocaust,
while I seek a meeting over there.” 16 Then the LORD met Balaam, and having put an utterance
in his mouth, he said to him, “Go back to Balak, and speak accordingly.” 17 So he went back to
Balak, who was still standing by his holocaust together with the princes of Moab. When Balak
asked him, “What did the LORD say?” 18 Balaam gave voice to his oracle: “Be aroused, O
Balak, and hearken; give ear to my testimony, O son of Zippor! 19 God is not man that he should
speak falsely, nor human, that he should change his mind. Is he one to speak and not act, to
decree and not fulfill? 20 It is a blessing I have been given to pronounce; a blessing which I
cannot restrain. 21 Misfortune is not observed in Jacob, nor misery seen in Israel. The LORD, his
God, is with him; with him is the triumph of his King. 22 It is God who brought him out of
Egypt, a wild bull of towering might. 23 No, there is no sorcery against Jacob, nor omen against
Israel. It shall yet be said of Jacob, and of Israel, ‘Behold what God has wrought!’ 24 Here is a
people that springs up like a lioness, and stalks forth like a lion; It rests not till it has devoured its
prey and has drunk the blood of the slain.”
25 “Even though you cannot curse them,” said Balak to Balaam, “at least do not bless
them.” 26 But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not warn you that I must do all that the LORD
tells me?”
The Third Oracle. 27 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me bring you to another
place; perhaps God will approve of your cursing them for me from there.” 28 So he took Balaam
Books of Moses

144

to the top of Peor, that overlooks Jeshimon. 29 Balaam then said to him, “Here build me seven
altars; and here prepare for me seven bullocks and seven rams.” 30 And Balak did as Balaam had
ordered, offering a bullock and a ram on each altar.
Num. 24
1 Balaam, however, perceiving that the LORD was pleased to bless Israel, did not go aside
as before to seek omens, but turned his gaze toward the desert. 2 When he raised his eyes and
saw Israel encamped, tribe by tribe, the spirit of God came upon him, 3 and he gave voice to his
oracle: “The utterance of Balaam, son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eye is true, 4 The
utterance of one who hears what God says, and knows what the Most High knows, Of one who
sees what the Almighty sees, enraptured, and with eyes unveiled: 5 How goodly are your tents, O
Jacob; your encampments, O Israel! 6 They are like gardens beside a stream, like the cedars
planted by the LORD. 7 His wells shall yield free-flowing waters, he shall have the sea within
reach; His king shall rise higher than... and his royalty shall be exalted. 8 It is God who brought
him out of Egypt, a wild bull of towering might. He shall devour the nations like grass, their
bones he shall strip bare. 9 He lies crouching like a lion, or like a lioness; who shall arouse him?
Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you!”
10 Balak beat his palms together in a blaze of anger at Balaam and said to him, “It was to
curse my foes that I summoned you here; yet three times now you have even blessed them
instead! 11 Be off at once, then, to your home. I promised to reward you richly, but the LORD
has withheld the reward from you!” 12 Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not warn the very
messengers whom you sent to me, 13 ‘Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I
could not of my own accord to anything, good or evil, contrary to the command of the LORD’?
Whatever the LORD says I must repeat.
The Fourth Oracle. 14 “But now that I am about to go to my own people, let me first warn
you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.” 15 Then Balaam gave voice to
his oracle: “The utterance of Balaam, son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eye is true, 16
The utterance of one who hears what God says, and knows what the Most High knows, Of one
who sees what the Almighty sees, enraptured and with eyes unveiled. 17 I see him, though not
now; I behold him, though not near: A star shall advance from Jacob, and a staff shall rise from
Israel, That shall smite the brows of Moab, and the skulls of all the Shuthites, 18 Till Edom is
dispossessed, and no fugitive is left in Seir. Israel shall do valiantly, 19 and Jacob shall overcome
his foes.” 20 Upon seeing Amalek, Balaam gave voice to his oracle: “First of the peoples was
Amalek, but his end is to perish forever.” 21 Upon seeing the Kenites, he gave voice to his
oracle: “Your abode is enduring, O smith, and your nest is set on a cliff; 22 Yet destined for
burning— even as I watch—are your inhabitants.” 23 Upon seeing... he gave voice to his oracle:
“Alas, who shall survive of Ishmael, 24 to deliver his people from the hands of the Kittim? When
they have conquered Asshur and conquered Eber, He too shall perish forever.”
25 Then Balaam set out on his journey home; and Balak also went his way.
Num. 25
Worship of Baal of Peor. 1 While Israel was living at Shittim, the people degraded
themselves by having illicit relations with the Moabite women. 2 These then invited the people
to the sacrifices of their god, and the people ate of the sacrifices and worshiped their god. 3
When Israel thus submitted to the rites of Baal of Peor, the LORD’S anger flared up against
Israel, 4 and he said to Moses, “Gather all the leaders of the people, and hold a public execution
of the guilty ones before the LORD, that his blazing wrath may be turned away from Israel.” 5
So Moses told the Israelite judges, “Each of you shall kill those of his men who have submitted
to the rites of Baal of Peor.”
Zeal of Phinehas. 6 Yet a certain Israelite came and brought in a Midianite woman to his
Books of Moses

145

clansmen in the view of Moses and of the whole Israelite community, while they were weeping
at the entrance of the meeting tent. 7 When Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest,
saw this, he left the assembly, and taking a lance in hand, 8 followed the Israelite into his retreat
where he pierced the pair of them, the Israelite and the woman. Thus the slaughter of Israelites
was checked; 9 but only after twenty-four thousand had died.
10 Then the LORD said to Moses, 11 “Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has
turned my anger from the Israelites by his zeal for my honor among them; that is why I did not
put an end to the Israelites for the offense to my honor. 12 Announce, therefore, that I hereby
give him my pledge of friendship, 13 which shall be for him and for his descendants after him
the pledge of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous on behalf of his God and thus
made amends for the Israelites.”
14 The Israelite slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri, son of Salu, prince of an
ancestral house of the Simeonites. 15 The slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, daughter of Zur,
who was head of a clan, an ancestral house, in Midian.
Vengence on the Midianites. 16 The LORD then said to Moses, 17 “Treat the Midianites
as enemies and crush them, 18 for they have been your enemies by their wily dealings with you
as regards Peor and as regards their kinswoman Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite prince, who
was killed at the time of the slaughter because of Peor.”
Num. 26
The Second Census. 25:19 After the slaughter 1 the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar; son
of Aaron the priest, 2 “Take a census, by ancestral houses, throughout the community of the
Israelites of all those of twenty years or more who are fit for military service in Israel.” 3 So on
the plains of Moab along the Jericho stretch of the Jordan, Moses and the priest Eleazar
registered 4 those of twenty years or more, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
The Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt were as follows:
5 Of Reuben, the first-born of Israel, the Reubenites by clans were: through Hanoch the clan
of the Hanochites, through Pallu the clan of the Palluites, 6 through Hezron the clan of the
Hezronites, through Carmi the clan of the Carmites. 7 These were the clans of the Reubenites, of
whom forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty men were registered.
8 From Pallu descended Eliab, 9 and the descendants of Eliab were Dathan and Abiram - the
same Dathan and Abiram, councilors of the community, who revolted against Moses and Aaron
(like Korah’s band when it rebelled against the LORD). 10 The earth opened its mouth and
swallowed them as a warning (Korah too and the band that died when the fire consumed two
hundred and fifty men. 11 The descendents of Korah, however, did not die out).
12 The Simeonites by clans were: through Nemuel the clan of the Nemuelites, through
Jamin the clan of the Jaminites, through Jachin the clan of the Jachinites, 13 through Sohar the
clan of the Soharites, through Shaul the clan of the Shaulites. 14 These were the clans of the

by clans were: through Shelah the clan of the Shelahites, through Perez the clan of the Perezites,
through Zerah the clan of the Zerahites. 21 The Perezites were: through Hezron the clan of the
Hezronites, through Hamul the clan of the Hamulites. 22 These were the clans of Judah, of
whom seventy-six thousand five hundred men were registered.
23 The Issacharites by clans were: through Tola the clan of the Tolaites, through Puvah the
Books of Moses

146

clan of the Puvahites, 24 through Jashub the clan of the Jashubites, through Shimron the clan of
the Shimronites. 25 These were the clans of Issachar, of whom sixty-four thousand three hundred
men were registered.
26 The Zebulunites by clans were: through Sered the clan of the Seredites, through Elon the
clan of the Elonites, through Jahleel the clan of the Jahleelites. 27 These were the clans of the
Zebulunites, of whom sixty thousand five hundred men were registered.
28 The sons of Joseph were Manasseh and Ephraim. 29 The Manassehites by clans were:
through Machir the clan of the Machirites, through Gilead, a descendant of Machir, the clan of
the Gileadites. 30 The Gileadites were: through Abiezer the clan of the Abiezrites, through Helek
the clan of the Helekites, 31 through Asriel the clan of the Asrielites, through Shechem the clan
of the Shechemites, 32 through Shemida the clan of the Shemidaites, through Hepher the clan of
the Hepherites. 33 Zelophehad, son of Hepher, had no sons, but only daughters, whose names
were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 34 These were the clans of Manasseh, of whom
fifty-two thousand seven hundred men were registered.
35 The Ephraimites by clans were: through Shuthelah the clan of the Shuthelahites, through
Becher the clan of the Bechrites, through Tahan the clan of the Tahanites. 36 The Shuthelahites
were: through Eran the clan of the Eranites. 37 These were the clans of the Ephraimites, of
whom thirty-two thousand five hundred men were registered.
These were the descendants of Joseph by clans.
38 The Benjaminites by clans were: through Bela the clan of the Belaites, through Ashbel
the clan of the Ashbelites, through Ahiram the clan of the Ahiramites, 39 through Shupham the
clan of the Shuphamites, through Hupham the clan of the Huphamites. 40 The descendants of
Bela were Arad and Naaman: through Arad the clan of the Aradites, through Naaman the clan of
the Naamanites. 41 These were the Benjaminites by clans, of whom forty-five thousand six
hundred men were registered.
42 The Danites by clans were: through Shuham the clan of the Shuhamites. These were the
clans of Dan, 43 of whom sixty-four thousand four hundred men were registered.
44 The Asherites by clans were: through Imnah the clan of the Imnites, through Ishvi the
clan of the Ishvites, through Beriah the clan of the Beriites, 45 through Heber the clan of the
Heberites, through Malchiel the clan of the Malchielites. 46 The name of Asher’s daughter was
Serah. 47 These were the clans of Asher, of whom fifty-three thousand four hundred men were
registered.
48 The Naphtalites by clans were: through Jahzeel the clan of the Jahzeelites, through Guni
the clan of the Gunites, 49 through Jezer the clan of the Jezerites, through Shillem the clan of the
Shillemites. 50 These were the clans of Naphtali, of whom forty-five thousand four hundred men
were registered.
51 These six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty were the Israelites who
were registered.
Allotment of the Land. 52 The LORD said to Moses, 53 “Among these groups the land
shall be divided as their heritage in keeping with the number of individuals in each group. 54 To
a large group you shall assign a large heritage, to a small group a small heritage, each group
receiving its heritage in proportion to the number of men registered in it. 55 But the land shall be
divided by lot, as the heritage of the various ancestral tribes. 56 As the lot falls shall each group,
large or small, be assigned its heritage.”
Census of the Levites. 57 The Levites registered by clans were: through Gershon the clan
of the Gershonites, through Kohath the clan of the Kohathites, through Merari the clan of the
Merarites. 58 These also were clans of Levi: the clan of the Libnites, the clan of the Hebronites,
the clan of the Mahlites, the clan of the Mushites, the clan of the Korahites.
Among the descendants of Kohath was Amram, 59 whose wife was named Jochebed. She
also was of the tribe of Levi, born to the tribe in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron and Moses
Books of Moses

147

and their sister Miriam. 60 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 61 But
Nadab and Abihu died when they offered profane fire before the LORD.
62 The total number of male Levites one month or more of age, who were registered, was
twenty-three thousand. They were not registered with the other Israelites, however, for no
heritage was given them among the Israelites.
63 These, then, were the men registered by Moses and the priest Eleazar in the census of the
Israelites taken on the plains of Moab along the Jericho stretch of the Jordan. 64 Among them
there was not a man of those who had been registered by Moses and the priest Aaron in the
census of the Israelites taken in the desert of Sinai. 65 For the LORD had told them that they
would surely die in the desert, and not one of them was left except Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua, son of Nun.
Num. 27
Zelophehad’s Daughters. 1 Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son
of Manasseh, son of Joseph, had daughters named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.
They came forward, 2 and standing in the presence of Moses, the priest Eleazar, the princes, and
the whole community at the entrance of the meeting tent, said: 3 “Our father died in the desert.
Although he did not join those who banded together against the LORD (in Korah’s band), he
died for his own sin without leaving any sons. 4 But why should our father’s name be withdrawn
from his clan merely because he had no son? Let us, therefore, have property among our father’s
kinsmen.”
Laws Concerning Heiresses. 5 When Moses laid their case before the LORD, 6 the LORD
said to him, 7 “The plea of Zelophehad’s daughters is just; you shall give them hereditary
property among their father’s kinsmen, letting their father’s heritage pass on to them. 8
Therefore, tell the Israelites: If a man dies without leaving a son, you shall let his heritage pass
on to his daughter; 9 if he has no daughter, you shall give his heritage to his brothers; 10 if he has
no brothers, you shall give his heritage to his father’s brothers; 11 if his father had no brothers,
you shall give his heritage to his nearest relative in his clan, who shall then take possession of it.”
This is the legal norm for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Joshua to Succeed Moses. 12 The LORD said to Moses, “Go up here into the Abarim
Mountains and view the land that I am giving to the Israelites. 13 When you have viewed it, you
too shall be taken to your people, as was your brother Aaron, 14 because in the rebellion of the
community in the desert of Zin you both rebelled against my order to manifest my sanctity to
them by means of the water.” (This is the water of Meribah of Kadesh in the desert of Zin.)
15 Then Moses said to the LORD, 16 “May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all
mankind, set over the community a man 17 who shall act as their leader in all things, to guide
them in all their actions; that the LORD’S community may not be like sheep without a
shepherd.” 18 And the LORD replied to Moses, “Take Joshua, son of Nun, a man of spirit, and
lay your hand upon him. 19 Have him stand in the presence of the priest Eleazar and of the
whole community, and commission him before their eyes. 20 Invest him with some of your own
dignity, that the whole Israelite community may obey him. 21 He shall present himself to the
priest Eleazar, to have him seek out for him the decisions of the Urim in the LORD’S presence;
and as he directs, Joshua, all the Israelites with him, and the community as a whole shall perform
all their actions.”
22 Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. Taking Joshua and having him stand in the
presence of the priest Eleazar and of the whole community, 23 he laid his hands on him and gave
him his commission, as the LORD had directed through Moses.

General Sacrifices. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Give the Israelites this commandment:
At the times I have appointed, you shall be careful to present to me the food offerings that are
offered to me as sweet-smelling oblations.
Each Morning and Evening. 3 “You shall tell them therefore: This is the oblation which
you shall offer to the LORD: two unblemished yearling lambs each day as the established
holocaust, 4 offering one lamb in the morning and the other during the evening twilight, 5 each
with a cereal offering of one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil of
crushed olives. 6 This is the established holocaust that was offered at Mount Sinai as a sweetsmelling oblation to the LORD. 7 And as the libation for the first lamb, you shall pour out to the
LORD in the sanctuary a fourth of a hin of wine. 8 The other lamb, to be offered during the
evening twilight, you shall offer with the same cereal offering and the same libation as in the
morning, as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
On the Sabbath. 9 “On the sabbath day you shall offer two unblemished yearling lambs,
with their cereal offering, two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and with their
libations. 10 Each sabbath there shall be the sabbath holocaust in addition to the established
holocaust and its libation.
At New Moon Feast. 11 “On the first of each month you shall offer as a holocaust to the
LORD two bullocks, one ram, and seven unblemished yearling lambs, 12 with three tenths of an
ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as the cereal offering for each bullock, two tenths of an ephah
of fine flour mixed with oil as the cereal offering for the ram, 13 and one tenth of an ephah of
fine flour mixed with oil as the cereal offering for each lamb, that the holocaust may be a sweetsmelling oblation to the LORD. 14 Their libations shall be half a hin of wine for each bullock, a
third of a hin for the ram, and a fourth of a hin for each lamb. This is the new moon holocaust for
every new moon of the year. 15 Moreover, one goat shall be sacrificed as a sin offering to the
LORD. These are to be offered in addition to the established holocaust and its libation.
At the Passover. 16 “On the fourteenth day of the first month falls the Passover of the
LORD, 17 and the fifteenth day of this month is the pilgrimage feast. For seven days unleavened
bread is to be eaten. 18 On the first of these days you shall hold a sacred assembly, and do no
sort of work. 19 As an oblation you shall offer a holocaust to the LORD, which shall consist of
two bullocks, one ram, and seven yearling lambs that you are sure are unblemished, 20 with their
cereal offerings of fine flour mixed with oil; offering three tenths of an ephah for each bullock,
two tenths for the ram, 21 and one tenth for each of the seven lambs; 22 and offer one goat as a
sin offering in atonement for yourselves. 23 These offerings you shall make in addition to the
established morning holocaust: 24 you shall make exactly the same offerings each day for seven
days as food offerings, in addition to the established holocaust with its libation, for a sweetsmelling oblation to the LORD. 25 On the seventh day you shall hold a sacred assembly, and do
no sort of work.
At Pentecost. 26 “On the day of first fruits, on your feast of Weeks, when you present to
the LORD the new cereal offering, you shall hold a sacred assembly, and do no sort of work. 27
You shall offer as a sweet-smelling holocaust to the LORD two bullocks, one ram, and seven
yearling lambs that you are sure are unblemished, 28 with their cereal offerings of fine flour
mixed with oil; offering three tenths of an ephah for each bullock, two tenths for the ram, 29 and
one tenth for each of the seven lambs. 30 Moreover, one goat shall be offered as a sin offering in
atonement for yourselves. 31 You shall make these offerings, together with their libations, in
addition to the established holocaust with its cereal offering.
Num. 29
On New Year’s Day. 1 “On the first day of the seventh month you shall hold a sacred
assembly, and do no sort of work; it shall be a day on which you sound the trumpet. 2 You shall

149

offer as a sweet-smelling holocaust to the LORD one bullock, one ram, and seven unblemished
yearling lambs, 3 with their cereal offerings of fine flour mixed with oil; offering three tenths of
an ephah for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, 4 and one tenth for each of the seven lambs. 5
Moreover, one goat shall be offered as a sin offering in atonement for yourselves. 6 These are to
be offered in addition to the ordinary new-moon holocaust with its cereal offering, and in
addition to the established holocaust with its cereal offering, together with the libations
prescribed for them, as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD.
On the Day of Atonement. 7 “On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall hold a
sacred assembly, and mortify yourselves, and do no sort of work. 8 You shall offer as a sweetsmelling holocaust to the LORD one bullock, one ram, and seven yearling lambs that you are
sure are unblemished, 9 with their cereal offerings of fine flour mixed with oil; offering three
tenths of an ephah for the bullock, two tenths for the ram, 10 and one tenth for each of the seven
lambs. 11 Moreover, one goat shall be sacrificed as a sin offering. These are to be offered in
addition to the atonement sin offering, the established holocaust with its cereal offering, and their
libations.
On the Feast of Booths. 12 “On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall hold a
sacred assembly, and do no sort of work; then, for seven days following, you shall celebrate a
pilgrimage feast to the LORD. 13 You shall offer as a sweet-smelling holocaust to the LORD
thirteen bullocks, two rams, and fourteen yearling lambs that are unblemished, 14 with their
cereal offerings of fine flour mixed with oil; offering three tenths of an ephah for each of the
thirteen bullocks, two tenths for each of the two rams, 15 and one tenth for each of the fourteen
lambs. 16 Moreover, one goat shall be sacrificed as a sin offering. These are to be offered in
addition to the established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
17 “On the second day you shall offer twelve bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 18 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 19 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
20 “On the third day you shall offer eleven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 21 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 22 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
23 “On the fourth day you shall offer ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 24 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 25 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
26 “On the fifth day you shall offer nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 27 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 28 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
29 “On the sixth day you shall offer eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 30 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 31 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
32 “On the seventh day you shall offer seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen unblemished
yearling lambs, 33 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for the bullocks, rams
and lambs in proportion to their number, 34 as well as one goat for a sin offering, besides the
established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
35 “On the eighth day you shall hold a solemn meeting, and do no sort of work. 36 You
shall offer up in holocaust as a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD one bullock, one ram, and
seven unblemished yearling lambs, 37 with their cereal offerings and libations as prescribed for
Books of Moses

150

the bullocks, rams and lambs in proportion to their number, 38 as well as one goat for a sin
offering, besides the established holocaust with its cereal offering and libation.
39 “These are the offerings you shall make to the LORD on your festivals, besides whatever
holocausts, cereal offerings, libations, and peace offerings you present as your votive or freewill
offerings.”
Num. 30
1 Moses then gave the Israelites these instructions, just as the LORD had ordered him.
Validity and Annulment of Vows. 2 Moses said to the heads of the Israelite tribes, “This is
what the LORD has commanded: 3 When a man makes a vow to the LORD or binds himself
under oath to a pledge of abstinence, he shall not violate his word, but must fulfill exactly the
promise he has uttered.
4 “When a woman, while still a maiden in her father’s house, makes a vow to the LORD, or
binds herself to a pledge, 5 if her father learns of her vow or the pledge to which she bound
herself and says nothing to her about it, then any vow or any pledge she has made remains valid.
6 But if on the day he learns of it her father expresses to her his disapproval, then any vow or any
pledge she has made becomes null and void; and the LORD releases her from it, since her father
has expressed to her his disapproval.
7 “If she marries while under a vow or under a rash pledge to which she bound herself, 8
and her husband learns of it, yet says nothing to her that day about it, then the vow or pledge she
had made remains valid. 9 But if on the day he learns of it her husband expresses to her his
disapproval, he thereby annuls the vow she had made or the rash pledge to which she had bound
herself, and the LORD releases her from it. 10 The vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, or
any pledge to which such a woman binds herself, is valid.
11 “If it is in her husband’s house that she makes a vow or binds herself under oath to a
pledge, 12 and her husband learns of it yet says nothing to express to her his disapproval, then
any vow or any pledge she has made remains valid. 13 But if on the day he learns of them her
husband annuls them, then whatever she has expressly promised in her vow or in her pledge
becomes null and void; since her husband has annulled them, the LORD releases her from them.
14 “Any vow or any pledge that she makes under oath to mortify herself, her husband can
either allow to remain valid or render null and void. 15 But if her husband, day after day, says
nothing at all to her about them, he thereby allows as valid any vow or any pledge she has made;
he has allowed them to remain valid, because on the day he learned of them he said nothing to
her about them. 16 If, however, he countermands them some time after he first learned of them,
he is responsible for her guilt.”
17 These are the statutes which the LORD prescribed through Moses concerning the
relationship between a husband and his wife, as well as between a father and his daughter while
she is still a maiden in her father’s house.
Num. 31
Extermination of the Midianites. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Avenge the Israelites on
the Midianites, and then you shall be taken to your people.” 3 So Moses told the people, “Select
men from your midst and arm them for war, to attack the Midianites and execute the LORD’S
vengeance on them. 4 From each of the tribes of Israel you shall send a band of one thousand
men to war.” 5 From the clans of Israel, therefore, a thousand men of each tribe were levied, so
that there were twelve thousand men armed for war. 6 Moses sent them out on the campaign, a
thousand from each tribe, with Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest for the campaign, who had
with him the sacred vessels and the trumpets for sounding the alarm. 7 They waged war against
the Midianites, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed every male among them. 8
Besides those slain in battle, they killed the five Midianite kings: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and
Books of Moses

151

Reba; and they also executed Balaam, son of Beor, with the sword. 9 But the Israelites kept the
women of the Midianites with their little ones as captives, and all their herds and flocks and
wealth as spoil, 10 while they set on fire all the towns where they had settled and all their
encampments. 11 Then they took all the booty, with the people and beasts they had captured, and
brought the captives, together with the spoils and booty, 12 to Moses and the priest Eleazar and
to the Israelite community at their camp on the plains of Moab, along the Jericho stretch of the
Jordan.
Treatment of the Captives. 13 When Moses and the priest Eleazar, with all the princes of
the community, went outside the camp to meet them, 14 Moses became angry with the officers
of the army, the clan and company commanders, who were returning from combat. 15 “So you
have spared all the women!” he exclaimed. 16 “Why, they are the very ones who on Balaam’s
advice prompted the unfaithfulness of the Israelites toward the LORD in the Peor affair, which
began the slaughter of the LORD’S community. 17 Slay, therefore, every male child and every
woman who has had intercourse with a man. 18 But you may spare and keep for yourselves all
girls who had no intercourse with a man.
Purification After Combat. 19 “Moreover, you shall stay outside the camp for seven days,
and those of you who have slain anyone or touched anyone slain in battle shall purify yourselves
on the third and on the seventh day. This applies both to you and to your captives. 20 You shall
also purify every article of cloth, leather, goats’ hair, or wood.”
21 Eleazar the priest told the soldiers who had returned from combat: “This is what the law,
as prescribed by the LORD to Moses, ordains: 22 Whatever can stand fire, such as gold, silver,
bronze, iron, tin and lead, 23 you shall put into the fire, that it may become clean; however, it
must also be purified with lustral water. But whatever cannot stand fire you shall put into the
water. 24 On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes, and then you will again be clean.
After that you may enter the camp.”
Division of the Booty. 25 The LORD said to Moses: 26 “With the help of the priest Eleazar
and of the heads of the ancestral houses, count up all the human captives and the beasts that have
been taken; 27 then divide them evenly, giving half to those who took active part in the war by
going out to combat, and half to the rest of the community. 28 You shall levy a tax for the LORD
on the warriors who went out to combat: one out of every five hundred persons, oxen, asses and
sheep 29 in their half of the spoil you shall turn over to the priest Eleazar as a contribution to the
LORD. 30 From the Israelites’ half you shall take one out of every fifty persons, and the same
from the different beasts, oxen, asses and sheep, and give them to the Levites, who have charge
of the LORD’S Dwelling.” 31 So Moses and the priest Eleazar did this, as the LORD had
commanded Moses.
Amount of Booty. 32 This booty, what was left of the loot which the soldiers had taken,
amounted to six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, 33 seventy-two thousand oxen, 34
sixty-one thousand asses, 35 and thirty-two thousand girls who were still virgins.
36 The half that fell to those who had gone out to combat was: three hundred and thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep, 37 of which six hundred and seventy-five fell as tax to the
LORD; 38 thirty-six thousand oxen, of which seventy-two fell as tax to the LORD; 39 thirty
thousand five hundred asses, of which sixty-one fell as tax to the LORD; 40 and sixteen
thousand persons, of whom thirty-two fell as tax to the LORD. 41 The taxes contributed to the
LORD, Moses gave to the priest Eleazar, as the LORD had commanded him.
42 The half for the other Israelites, which fell to the community when Moses had taken it
from the soldiers, was: 43 three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, 44 thirtysix thousand oxen, 45 thirty thousand five hundred asses, 46 and sixteen thousand persons. 47
From this, the Israelites’ share, Moses, as the LORD had ordered, took one out of every fifty,
both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites, who had charge of the LORD’S
Dwelling.

Gifts of the Officers. 48 Then the officers who had been clan and company commanders of
the army came up to Moses 49 and said to him, “Your servants have counted up the soldiers
under our command, and not one is missing. 50 So, to make atonement for ourselves before the
LORD, each of us will bring as an offering to the LORD some gold article he has picked up,
such as an anklet, a bracelet, a ring, an earring, or a necklace.” 51 Moses and the priest Eleazar
accepted this gold from them, all of it in well-wrought articles. 52 The gold that they gave as a
contribution to the LORD amounted in all to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
This was from the clan and company commanders; 53 what the common soldiers had looted each
one kept for himself. 54 Moses, then, and the priest Eleazar accepted the gold from the clan and
company commanders, and put it in the meeting tent as a memorial for the Israelites before the
LORD.
Num. 32
Request of Gad & Reuben. 1 Now the Reubenites and Gadites had a very large number of
livestock. Noticing that the land of Jazer and of Gilead was grazing country, 2 they came to
Moses and the priest Eleazar and to the princes of the community and said, 3 “The region of
Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Baal-meon, 4 which the
LORD has laid low before the community of Israel, is grazing country. Now, since your servants
have livestock,” 5 they continued, “if we find favor with you, let this land be given to your
servants as their property. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
Moses’ Rebuke. 6 But Moses answered the Gadites and Reubenites: “Are your kinsmen,
then, to engage in war, while you remain here? 7 Why do you wish to discourage the Israelites
from crossing to the land the LORD has given them? 8 That is just what your fathers did when I
sent them from Kadesh-barnea to reconnoiter the land. 9 They went up to the Wadi Eshcol and
reconnoitered the land, then so discouraged the Israelites that they would not enter the land the
LORD had given them. 10 At that time the wrath of the LORD flared up, and he swore, 11
‘Because they have not followed me unreservedly, none of these men of twenty years or more
who have come up from Egypt shall ever see this country I promised under oath to Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob, 12 except the Kenizzite Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun, who
have followed the LORD unreservedly.’ 13 So in his anger with the Israelites the LORD made
them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation that had done evil in the sight
of the LORD had died out. 14 And now here you are, a brood of sinners, rising up in your
fathers’ place to add still more to the LORD’S blazing wrath against the Israelites. 15 If you turn
away from following him, he will make them stay still longer in the desert, and so you will bring
about the ruin of this whole nation.”
Counter Proposal. 16 But they were insistent with him: “We wish only to build sheepfolds
here for our flocks, and towns for our families; 17 but we ourselves will march as troops in the
van of the Israelites, until we have led them to their destination. Meanwhile our families can
remain here in the fortified towns, safe from attack by the natives. 18 We will not return to our
homes until every one of the Israelites has taken possession of his heritage, 19 and will not claim
any heritage with them once we cross the Jordan, so long as we receive a heritage for ourselves
on this eastern side of the Jordan.”
Agreement Reached. 20 Moses said to them in reply: “If you keep your word to march as
troops in the LORD’S vanguard 21 and to cross the Jordan in full force before the LORD until he
has driven his enemies out of his way 22 and the land is subdued before him, then you may
return here, quit of every obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and this region shall be your
possession before the LORD. 23 But if you do not do this, you will sin against the LORD, and
you can be sure that you will not escape the consequences of your sin. 24 Build the towns, then,
for your families, and the folds for your flocks, but also fulfill your express promise.”
25 The Gadites and Reubenites answered Moses, “Your servants will do as you command,
Books of Moses

153

my lord. 26 While our wives and children, our herds and other livestock remain in the towns of
Gilead, 27 all your servants will go across as armed troops to battle before the LORD, just as
your lordship says.”
28 Moses, therefore, gave this order in their regard to the priest Eleazar, to Joshua, son of
Nun, and to the heads of the ancestral tribes of the Israelites: 29 “If all the Gadites and
Reubenites cross the Jordan with you as combat troops before the LORD, you shall give them
Gilead as their property when the land has been subdued before you. 30 But if they will not go
across with you as combat troops before the LORD, you shall bring their wives and children and
livestock across before you into Canaan, and they shall have their property with you in the land
of Canaan.”
31 To this the Gadites and Reubenites replied, “We will do what the LORD has commanded
us, your servants. 32 We ourselves will go across into the land of Canaan as troops before the
LORD, but we will retain our hereditary property on this side of the Jordan.” 33 So Moses gave
them (the Gadites and Reubenites, as well as half the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the
kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan,) the land with
its towns and the districts that surrounded them.
34 The Gadites rebuilt the fortified towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35 Atroth-shophan,
Jazer, Jogbehah, 36 Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, and they built sheepfolds. 37 The Reubenites
rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38 Nebo, Baal-meon (names to be changed!), and Sibmah.
These towns, which they rebuilt, they called by their old names.
Other Conquests. 39 The descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh, invaded Gilead and
captured it, driving out the Amorites who were there. 40 (Moses gave Gilead to Machir, son of
Manasseh, and he settled there.) 41 Jair, a Manassehite clan, campaigned against the tent
villages, captured them and called them Havvoth-jair. 42 Nobah also campaigned against
Kenath, captured it with its dependencies and called it Nobah after his own name.
Num. 33
Stages on the Journey. 1 The following are the stages by which the Israelites journeyed up
by companies from the land of Egypt under the guidance of Moses and Aaron. 2 By the LORD’S
command Moses recorded the starting places of the various stages. The starting places of the
successive stages were: 3 They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of
the first month. On the Passover morrow the Israelites went forth in triumph, in view of all
Egypt, 4 While the Egyptians buried their first-born all of whom the LORD had struck down;
on their gods, too, the LORD executed judgments.
From Egypt to Sinai. 5 Setting out from Rameses, the Israelites camped at Succoth. 6
Setting out from Succoth, they camped at Etham near the edge of the desert. 7 Setting out from
Etham, they turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which is opposite Baal-zephon, and they camped
opposite Migdol. 8 Setting out from Pi-hahiroth, they crossed over through the sea into the
desert, and after a three days’ journey in the desert of Etham, they camped at Marah. 9 Setting
out from Marah, they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm
trees, and they camped there. 10 Setting out from Elim, they camped beside the Red Sea. 11
Setting out from the Red Sea, they camped in the desert of Sin. 12 Setting out from the desert of
Sin, they camped at Dophkah. 13 Setting out from Dophkah, they camped at Alush. 14 Setting
out from Alush, they camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. 15
Setting out from Rephidim, they camped in the desert of Sinai.
From Sinai to Kadesh. 16 Setting out from the desert of Sinai, they camped at Kibrothhattaavah. 17 Setting out from Kibroth-hattaavah, they camped at Hazeroth. 18 Setting out from
Hazeroth, they camped at Rithmah. 19 Setting out from Rithmah, they camped at Rimmon-perez.
20 Setting out from Rimmon-perez, they camped at Libnah. 21 Setting out from Libnah, they
camped at Rissah. 22 Setting out from Rissah, they camped at Kehelathah. 23 Setting out from
Books of Moses

154

Kehelathah, they camped at Mount Shepher. 24 Setting out from Mount Shepher, they camped at
Haradah. 25 Setting out from Haradah, they camped at Makheloth. 26 Setting out from
Makheloth, they camped at Tahath. 27 Setting out from Tahath, they camped at Terah. 28 Setting
out from Terah, they camped at Mithkah. 29 Setting out from Mithkah, they camped at
Hashmonah. 30 Setting out from Hashmonah, From Mount Hor to Ezion-geber. They camped at Moseroth. 31 Setting out from
Moseroth, they camped at Bene-jaakan. 32 Setting out from Bene-jaakan, they camped at Mount
Gidgad. 33 Setting out from Mount Gidgad, they camped at Jotbathah. 34 Setting out from
Jotbathah, they camped at Abronah. 35 Setting out from Abronah, they camped at Ezion-geber.
36 Setting out from Ezion-geber, From Kadesh to Mount Hor. They camped in the desert of Zin, at Kadesh. 37 Setting out
from Kadesh, they camped at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom. 38 (Aaron the priest
ascended Mount Hor at the LORD’S command, and there he died in the fortieth year from the
departure of the Israelites from the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month. 39 Aaron
was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 40 Now, when the
Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb in the land of Canaan, heard that the Israelites
were coming...) 41 Setting out from Mount Hor, From Ezion-geber to the Plains of Moab. They camped at Zalmonah. 42 Setting out from
Zalmonah, they camped at Punon. 43 Setting out from Punon, they camped at Oboth. 44 Setting
out from Oboth, they camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab. 45 Setting out from Iyeabarim, they camped at Dibon-gad. 46 Setting out from Dibon-gad, they camped at Almondiblathaim. 47 Setting out from Almon-diblathaim, they camped in the Abarim Mountains
opposite Nebo. 48 Setting out from the Abarim Mountains, they camped on the plains of Moab
along the Jericho stretch of the Jordan. 49 Their camp along the Jordan on the plains of Moab
extended from Beth-jeshimoth to Abelshittim.
Conquest and Division of Canaan. 50 The LORD spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab
beside the Jericho stretch of the Jordan and said to him: 51 “Tell the Israelites: When you go
across the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 52 drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you;
destroy all their stone figures and molten images, and demolish all their high places.
53 “You shall take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land as
your property. 54 You shall apportion the land among yourselves by lot, clan by clan, assigning a
large heritage to a large group and a small heritage to a small group. Wherever anyone’s lot falls,
there shall his property be within the heritage of his ancestral tribe.
55 “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those whom you allow
to remain will become as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in
the country where you live, 56 and I will treat you as I had intended to treat them.”
Num. 34
The Boundaries. 1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Give the Israelites this order: When you
enter the land of Canaan, this is the territory that shall fall to you as your heritage—the land of
Canaan with its boundaries:
3 “Your southern boundary shall be at the desert of Zin along the border of Edom; on the
east it shall begin at the end of the Salt Sea, 4 and turning south of the Akrabbim Pass, it shall
cross Zin, and extend south of Kadesh-barnea to Hazar-addar; thence it shall cross to Azmon, 5
and turning from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt, shall terminate at the Sea.
6 “For your western boundary you shall have the Great Sea with its coast; this shall be your
western boundary.
7 “The following shall be your boundary on the north: from the Great Sea you shall draw a
line to Mount Hor, 8 and shall continue it from Mount Hor to Labo in the land of Hamath, with
the boundary extending through Zedad. 9 Thence the boundary shall reach to Ziphron and
Books of Moses

155

terminate at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern boundary.
10 “For your eastern boundary you shall draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham. 11 From
Shepham the boundary shall go down to Ar-Baal, east of Ain, and descending further, shall strike
the ridge on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth; 12 thence the boundary shall continue along
the Jordan and terminate with the Salt Sea.
“This is the land that shall be yours, with the boundaries that surround it.”
13 Moses also gave this order to the Israelites: “This is the land, to be apportioned among
you by lot, which the LORD has commanded to be given to the nine and one half tribes. 14 For
all the ancestral houses of the tribe of Reuben, and the ancestral houses of the tribe of Gad, as
well as half of the tribe of Manasseh, have already received their heritage; 15 these two and one
half tribes have received their heritage on the eastern side of the Jericho stretch of the Jordan,
toward the sunrise.”
Supervisors of the Allotment. 16 The LORD said to Moses, 17 “These are the names of
the men who shall apportion the land among you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun, 18
and one prince from each of the tribes whom you shall designate for this task. 19 These shall be
as follows: from the tribe of Judah: Caleb, son of Jephunneh, 20 from the tribe of Simeon:
Samuel, son of Ammihud; 21 from the tribe of Benjamin: Elidad, son of Chislon; 22 from the
tribe of Dan: Bukki, son of Jogli; 23 from the tribe of Manasseh: Hanniel, son of Ephod; and 24
from the tribe of Ephraim: Kemuel, son of Shiphtan, for the descendants of Joseph; 25 from the
tribe of Zebulun: Elizaphan, son of Parnach; 26 from the tribe of Issachar: Paltiel, son of Azzan;
27 from the tribe of Asher: Ahihud, son of Shelomi; 28 from the tribe of Naphtali: Pedahel, son
of Ammihud.”
29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to assign the Israelites their heritage in the
land of Canaan.
Num. 35
Cities for the Levites. 1 The LORD gave these instructions to Moses on the plains of Moab
beside the Jericho stretch of the Jordan: 2 “Tell the Israelites that out of their hereditary property
they shall give the Levites cities for homes, as well as pasture lands around the cities. 3 The
cities shall serve them to dwell in, and the pasture lands shall serve their herds and flocks and
other animals. 4 The pasture lands of the cities to be assigned the Levites shall extend a thousand
cubits from the city walls in each direction. 5 Thus you shall measure out two thousand cubits
outside the city along each side - east, south, west and north - with the city lying in the center.
This shall serve them as the pasture lands of their cities.
6 “Now these are the cities you shall give to the Levites: the six cities of asylum which you
must establish as places where a homicide can take refuge, and in addition forty-two other
cities—7 a total of forty-eight cities with their pasture lands to be assigned the Levites. 8 In
assigning the cities from the property of the Israelites, take more from a larger group and fewer
from a smaller one, so that each group will cede cities to the Levites in proportion to its own
heritage.”
Cities of Asylum. 9 The LORD said to Moses, 10 “Tell the Israelites: When you go across
the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 11 select for yourselves cities to serve as cities of asylum,
where a homicide who has killed someone unintentionally may take refuge. 12 These cities shall
serve you as places of asylum from the avenger of blood, so that a homicide shall not be put to
death unless he is first tried before the community. 13 Six cities of asylum shall you assign: 14
three beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of Canaan. 15 These six cities of asylum shall
serve not only the Israelites but all the resident or transient aliens among them, so that anyone
who has killed another unintentionally may take refuge there.
Murder and Manslaughter. 16 “If a man strikes another with an iron instrument and
causes his death, he is a murderer and shall be put to death. 17 If a man strikes another with a
Books of Moses

156

death-dealing stone in his hand and causes his death, he is a murderer and shall be put to death.
18 If a man strikes another with a death-dealing club in his hand and causes his death, he is a
murderer and shall be put to death. 19 The avenger of blood may execute the murderer, putting
him to death on sight.
20 “If a man pushes another out of hatred, or after lying in wait for him throws something at
him, and causes his death, 21 or if he strikes another out of enmity and causes his death, he shall
be put to death as a murderer. The avenger of blood may execute the murderer on sight.
22 “However, if a man pushes another accidentally and not out of enmity, or if without lying
in wait for him he throws some object at him, 23 or without seeing him throws a death-dealing
stone which strikes him and causes his death, although he was not his enemy nor seeking to harm
him: 24 then the community, deciding the case between the slayer and the avenger of blood in
accordance with these norms, 25 shall free the homicide from the avenger of blood and shall
remand him to the city of asylum where he took refuge; and he shall stay there until the death of
the high priest who has been anointed with sacred oil. 26 If the homicide of his own accord
leaves the bounds of the city of asylum where he has taken refuge, 27 and the avenger of blood
finds him beyond these bounds and kills him, the avenger incurs no bloodguilt; 28 the homicide
was bound to stay in his city of asylum until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of
the high priest may the homicide return to his own district.
29 “These shall be norms for you and all your descendants, wherever you live, for rendering
judgment.
Witnesses. 30 “Whenever someone kills another, the evidence of witnesses is required for
the execution of the murderer. The evidence of a single witness is not sufficient for putting a
person to death.
No Indemnity. 31 “You shall not accept indemnity in place of the life of a murderer who
deserves the death penalty; he must be put to death. 32 Nor shall you accept indemnity to allow a
refugee to leave his city of asylum and again dwell elsewhere in the land before the death of the
high priest. 33 You shall not desecrate the land where you live. Since bloodshed desecrates the
land, the land can have no atonement for the blood shed on it except through the blood of him
who shed it. 34 Do not defile the land in which you live and in the midst of which I dwell; for I
am the LORD who dwells in the midst of the Israelites.”
Num. 36
Property of Heiresses. 1 The heads of the ancestral houses in the clan of descendants of
Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh - one of the Josephite clans - came up and laid this plea
before Moses and the priest Eleazar and before the princes who were the heads of the ancestral
houses of the other Israelites. 2 They said: “The LORD commanded you, my lord, to apportion
the land by lot among the Israelites; and you, my lord, were also commanded by the LORD to
give the heritage of our kinsman Zelophehad to his daughters. 3 But if they marry into one of the
other Israelite tribes, their heritage will be withdrawn from our ancestral heritage and will be
added to that of the tribe into which they marry; thus the heritage that fell to us by lot will be
diminished. 4 When the Israelites celebrate the jubilee year, the heritage of these women will be
permanently added to that of the tribe into which they marry and will be withdrawn from that of
our ancestral tribe.”
5 So Moses gave this regulation to the Israelites according to the instructions of the LORD:
“The tribe of the Josephites are right in what they say. 6 This is what the LORD commands with
regard to the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please, provided they marry
into a clan of their ancestral tribe, 7 so that no heritage of the Israelites will pass from one tribe
to another, but all the Israelites will retain their own ancestral heritage. 8 Therefore, every
daughter who inherits property in any of the Israelite tribes shall marry someone belonging to a
clan of her own ancestral tribe, in order that all the Israelites may remain in possession of their
Books of Moses

157

own ancestral heritage. 9 Thus, no heritage can pass from one tribe to another, but all the
Israelite tribes will retain their own ancestral heritage.”
10 The daughters of Zelophehad obeyed the command which the LORD had given to
Moses. 11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, Zelophehad’s daughters, married relatives
on their father’s side 12 within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph; hence
their heritage remained in the tribe of their father’s clan.
Conclusion. 13 These are the commandments and decisions which the LORD prescribed
for the Israelites through Moses, on the plains of Moab beside the Jericho stretch of the Jordan.

DEUTERONOMY
I. HISTORICAL REVIEW AND EXHORTATION
Deut. 1
Introduction. 1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan ( in
the desert, in the Arabah, opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and
Dizahab; 2 it is a journey of eleven days from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of the highlands
of Seir).
3 In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites all
the commands that the LORD had given him in their regard. 4 After he had defeated Sihon, king
of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in
Edrei, 5 Moses began to explain the law in the land of Moab beyond the Jordan, as follows:
Departure from Horeb. 6 “The LORD, our God, said to us at Horeb, ‘You have stayed
long enough at this mountain. 7 Leave here and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all
the surrounding regions, the land of the Canaanites in the Arabah, the mountains, the foothills,
the Negeb and the seacoast; to Lebanon, and as far as the Great River (the Euphrates). 8 I have
given that land over to you. Go now and occupy the land I swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, I would give to them and to their descendants.’
Appointment of Elders. 9 “At that time I said to you, ‘Alone, I am unable to carry you. 10
The LORD, your God, has so multiplied you that you are now as numerous as the stars in the
sky. 11 May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over, and bless
you as he promised! 12 But how can I alone bear the crushing burden that you are, along with
your bickering? 13 Choose wise, intelligent and experienced men from each of your tribes, that I
may appoint them as your leaders.’ 14 You answered me, ‘We agree to do as you have
proposed.’ 15 So I took outstanding men of your tribes, wise and experienced, and made them
your leaders as officials over thousands, over hundreds, over fifties and over tens, and other
tribal officers. 16 I charged your judges at that time, ‘Listen to complaints among your kinsmen,
and administer true justice to both parties even if one of them is an alien. 17 In rendering
judgment, do not consider who a person is; give ear to the lowly and to the great alike, fearing no
man, for judgment is God’s. Refer to me any case that is too hard for you and I will hear it.’ 18
Thereupon I gave you all the commands you were to fulfill.
The Twelve Scouts. 19 “Then, in obedience to the command of the LORD, our God, we set
out from Horeb and journeyed through the whole desert, vast and fearful as you have seen, in the
direction of the hill country of the Amorites. We had reached Kadesh-barnea 20 when I said to
you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD, our God, is giving
us. 21 The LORD, your God, has given this land over to you. Go up and occupy it, as the LORD,
the God of your fathers, commands you. Do not fear or lose heart.’ 22 Then all of you came up
to me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead to reconnoiter the land for us and report to us on the road
we must follow and the cities we must take.’ 23 Agreeing with the proposal, I chose twelve men
from your number, one from each tribe. 24 They set out into the hill country as far as the Wadi
Eshcol, and explored it. 25 Then, taking along some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down
to us and reported, ‘The land which the LORD, our God, gives us is good.’
Threats of Revolt. 26 “But you refused to go up, and after defying the command of the
LORD, your God, 27 you set to murmuring in your tents, ‘Out of hatred for us the LORD has
brought us up out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites and destroy
us. 28 What shall we meet with up there? Our kinsmen have made us fainthearted by reporting
that the people are stronger and taller than we, and their cities are large and fortified to the sky;
besides, they saw the Anakim there.’
29 “But I said to you, ‘Have no dread or fear of them. 30 The LORD, your God, who goes
before you, will himself fight for you, just as he took your part before your very eyes in Egypt,

159

31 as well as in the desert, where you saw how the LORD, your God, carried you, as a man
carries his child, all along your journey until you arrived at this place.’ 32 Despite this, you
would not trust the LORD, your God, 33 who journeys before you to find you a resting place—
by day in the cloud, and by night in the fire, to show the way you must go. 34 When the LORD
heard your words, he was angry; 35 and he swore, ‘Not one man of this evil generation shall look
upon the good land I swore to give to your fathers, 36 except Caleb, son of Jephunneh; he shall
see it. For to him and to his sons I will give the land he trod upon, because he has followed the
LORD unreservedly.’
37 “The LORD was angered against me also on your account, and said, ‘Not even you shall
enter there, 38 but your aide Joshua, son of Nun, shall enter. Encourage him, for he is to give
Israel its heritage. 39 Your little ones, who you said would become booty, and your children,
who as yet do not know good from bad—they shall enter; to them I will give it, and they shall
occupy it. 40 But as for yourselves: turn about and proceed into the desert on the Red Sea road.’
Unsuccessful Invasion. 41 “In reply you said to me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD.
We will go up ourselves and fight, just as the LORD, our God, commanded us.’ And each of you
girded on his weapons, making light of going up into the hill country. 42 But the LORD said to
me, ‘Warn them: Do not go up and fight, lest you be beaten down before your enemies, for I will
not be in your midst.’ 43 I gave you this warning but you would not listen. In defiance of the
LORD’S command you arrogantly marched off into the hill country. 44 Then the Amorites
living there came out against you and, like bees, chased you, cutting you down in Seir as far as
Hormah. 45 On your return you wept before the LORD, but he did not listen to your cry or give
ear to you. 46 That is why you had to stay as long as you did at Kadesh.
Deut. 2
Northward to Edom. 1 “When we did turn and proceed into the desert on the Red Sea
road, as the LORD had commanded me, we circled around the highlands of Seir for a long time.
2 Finally the LORD said to me, 3 ‘You have wandered round these highlands long enough; turn
and go north. 4 Give this order to the people: You are now about to pass through the territory of
your kinsmen, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. Though they are afraid of you, be very
careful 5 not to come in conflict with them, for I will not give you so much as a foot of their
land, since I have already given Esau possession of the highlands of Seir. 6 You shall purchase
from them with silver the food you eat and the well water you drink. 7 The LORD, your God,
has blessed you in all your undertakings; he has been concerned about your journey through this
vast desert. It is now forty years that he has been with you, and you have never been in want.’
Along Moab. 8 “Then we left behind us the Arabah route, Elath, Ezion-geber, and Seir,
where our kinsmen, the descendants of Esau, live; and we went on toward the desert of Moab. 9
And the LORD said to me, ‘Do not show hostility to the Moabites or engage them in battle, for I
will not give you possession of any of their land, since I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot
as their own. 10 (Formerly the Emim lived there, a people strong and numerous and tall like the
Anakim; 11 like them they were considered Rephaim. It was the Moabites who called them
Emim. 12 In Seir, however, the former inhabitants were the Horites; the descendants of Esau
dispossessed them, clearing them out of the way and taking their place, just as the Israelites have
done in the land of their heritage which the LORD has given them.) 13 Get ready, then, to cross
the Wadi Zered.’ So we crossed it. 14 Thirty-eight years had elapsed between our departure from
Kadesh-barnea and that crossing; in the meantime the whole generation of soldiers had perished
from the camp, as the LORD had sworn they should. 15 For it was the LORD’S hand that was
against them, till he wiped them out of the camp completely.
Along Ammon. 16 “When at length death had put an end to all the soldiers among the
people, 17 the LORD said to me, 18 ‘You are now about to leave Ar and the territory of Moab
behind. 19 As you come opposite the Ammonites, do not show hostility or come in conflict with
Books of Moses

160

them, for I will not give you possession of any land of the Ammonites, since I have given it to
the descendants of Lot as their own. 20 (This also was considered a country of the Rephaim from
its former inhabitants, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim, 21 a people strong and
numerous and tall like the Anakim. But these, too, the LORD cleared out of the way for the
Ammonites, who ousted them and took their place. 22 He had done the same for the descendants
of Esau, who dwell in Seir, by clearing the Horites out of their way, so that the descendants of
Esau have taken their place down to the present. 23 So also the Caphtorim, migrating from
Caphtor, cleared away the Avvim, who once dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, and took their
place.)
Defeat of Sihon. 24 ”‘Advance now across the Wadi Arnon. I now deliver into your hands
Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin the occupation; engage him in battle.
25 This day I will begin to put a fear and dread of you into every nation under the heavens, so
that at the mention of your name they will quake and tremble before you.’
26 “So I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with this
offer of peace: 27 ‘Let me pass through your country by the highway; I will go along it without
turning aside to the right or to the left. 28 For the food I eat which you will supply, and for the
water you give me to drink, you shall be paid in silver. Only let me march through, 29 as the
descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar have done, until I cross
the Jordan into the land which the LORD, our God, is about to give us.’ 30 But Sihon, king of
Heshbon, refused to let us pass through his land, because the LORD, your God, made him
stubborn in mind and obstinate in heart that he might deliver him up to you, as indeed he has
now done.
31 “Then the LORD said to me, ‘Now that I have already begun to hand over to you Sihon
and his land, begin the actual occupation.’ 32 So Sihon and all his people advanced against us to
join battle at Jahaz; 33 but since the LORD, our God, had delivered him to us, we defeated him
and his sons and all his people. 34 At that time we seized all his cities and doomed them all, with
their men, women and children; we left no survivor. 35 Our only booty was the livestock and the
loot of the captured cities. 36 From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon and from the city in the
wadi itself, as far as Gilead, no city was too well fortified for us to whom the LORD had
delivered them up. 37 However, in obedience to the command of the LORD, our God, you did
not encroach upon any of the Ammonite land, neither the region bordering on the Wadi Jabbok,
nor the cities of the highlands.
Deut. 3
Defeat of Og. 1 “Then we turned and proceeded toward Bashan. But Og, king of Bashan,
advanced against us with all his people to give battle at Edrei. 2 The LORD, however, said to
me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hand with all his people and his
land. Do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’ 3 And thus
the LORD, our God, delivered into our hands Og, king of Bashan, with all his people. We
defeated him so completely that we left him no survivor. 4 At that time we captured all his cities,
none of them eluding our grasp, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan: sixty
cities in all, 5 to say nothing of the great number of unwalled towns. All the cities were fortified
with high walls and gates and bars. 6 As we had done to Sihon, king of Heshbon, so also here we
doomed all the cities, with their men, women and children; 7 but all the livestock and the loot of
each city we took as booty for ourselves.
8 “And so at that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan the
territory from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon 9 (which is called Sirion by the Sidonians and
Senir by the Amorites), 10 comprising all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all the cities
of the kingdom of Og in Bashan including Salecah and Edrei. 11 (Og, king of Bashan, was the
last remaining survivor of the Rephaim. He had a bed of iron, nine regular cubits long and four
Books of Moses

161

wide, which is still preserved in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
Allotment of the Conquered Lands. 12 “When we occupied the land at that time, I gave
Reuben and Gad the territory from Aroer, on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, halfway up into the
highlands of Gilead, with the cities therein. 13 The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom
of Og, the whole Argob region, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All this region of Bashan
was once called a land of the Rephaim. 14 Jair, a Manassehite clan, took all the region of Argob
as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and called it after his own name Bashan
Havvoth-jair, the name it bears today.) 15 To Machir I gave Gilead, 16 and to Reuben and Gad
the territory from Gilead to the Wadi Arnon—including the wadi bed and its banks—and to the
Wadi Jabbok, which is the border of the Ammonites, 17 as well as the Arabah with the Jordan
and its eastern banks from Chinnereth to the Salt Sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
18 “At that time I charged them as follows: ‘The LORD, your God, has given you this land
as your own. But all you troops equipped for battle must cross over in the vanguard of your
brother Israelites. 19 Only your wives and children, as well as your livestock, of which I know
you have a large number, shall remain behind in the towns I have given you, 20 until the LORD
has settled your kinsmen as well, and they too possess the land which the LORD, your God, will
give them on the other side of the Jordan. Then you may all return to the possessions I have
given you.’
21 “It was then that I instructed Joshua, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the LORD, your God,
has done to both these kings; so, too, will the LORD do to all the kingdoms which you will
encounter over there. 22 Fear them not, for the LORD, your God, will fight for you.’
Refusal to Moses. 23 “And it was then that I besought the LORD, 24 ‘O Lord GOD, you
have begun to show to your servant your greatness and might. For what god in heaven or on
earth can perform deeds as mighty as yours? 25 Ah, let me cross over and see this good land
beyond the Jordan, this fine hill country, and the Lebanon!’ 26 But the LORD was angry with
me on your account and would not hear me. ‘Enough!’ the LORD said to me. ‘Speak to me no
more of this. 27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and look out to the west, and to the north, and to the
south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross this Jordan. 28 Commission Joshua, and
encourage and strengthen him, for he shall cross at the head of this people and shall put them in
possession of the land you are to see.’ 29 This was while we were in the ravine opposite Bethpeor.
Deut. 4
Advantages of Fidelity. 1 “Now, Israel, hear the statutes and decrees which I am teaching
you to observe, that you may live, and may enter in and take possession of the land which the
LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. 2 In your observance of the commandments of the
LORD, your God, which I enjoin upon you, you shall not add to what I command you nor
subtract from it. 3 You have seen with your own eyes what the LORD did at Baal-peor: the
LORD, your God, destroyed from your midst everyone that followed the Baal of Peor; 4 but you,
who clung to the LORD, your God, are all alive today. 5 Therefore, I teach you the statutes and
decrees as the LORD, my God, has commanded me, that you may observe them in the land you
are entering to occupy. 6 Observe them carefully, for thus will you give evidence of your
wisdom and intelligence to the nations, who will hear of all these statutes and say, ‘This great
nation is truly a wise and intelligent people.’ 7 For what great nation is there that has gods so
close to it as the LORD, our God, is to us whenever we call upon him? 8 Or what great nation
has statutes and decrees that are as just as this whole law which I am setting before you today?
Revelation at Horeb. 9 “However, take care and be earnestly on your guard not to forget
the things which your own eyes have seen, nor let them slip from your memory as long as you
live, but teach them to your children and to your children’s children. 10 There was the day on
which you stood before the LORD, your God, at Horeb, and he said to me, ‘Assemble the people
Books of Moses

162

for me; I will have them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me as long as they live in the
land and may so teach their children.’ 11 You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain,
which blazed to the very sky with fire and was enveloped in a dense black cloud. 12 Then the
LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no
form; there was only a voice. 13 He proclaimed to you his covenant, which he commanded you
to keep: the ten commandments, which he wrote on two tablets of stone. 14 The LORD charged
me at that time to teach you the statutes and decrees which you are to observe over in the land
you will occupy.
Danger of Idolatry. 15 “You saw no form at all on the day the LORD spoke to you at
Horeb from the midst of the fire. Be strictly on your guard, therefore, 16 not to degrade
yourselves by fashioning an idol to represent any figure, whether it be the form of a man or a
woman, 17 of any animal on the earth or of any bird that flies in the sky, 18 of anything that
crawls on the ground or of any fish in the waters under the earth. 19 And when you look up to
the heavens and behold the sun or the moon or any star among the heavenly hosts, do not be led
astray into adoring them and serving them. These the LORD, your God, has let fall to the lot of
all other nations under the heavens; 20 but you he has taken and led out of that iron foundry,
Egypt, that you might be his very own people, as you are today. 21 Since the LORD was angered
against me on your account and swore that I should not cross the Jordan nor enter the good land
which he is giving you as a heritage, 22 I myself shall die in this country without crossing the
Jordan; but you will cross over and take possession of that good land. 23 Take heed, therefore,
lest, forgetting the covenant which the LORD, your God, has made with you, you fashion for
yourselves against his command an idol in any form whatsoever. 24 For the LORD, your God, is
a consuming fire, a jealous God.
God’s Fidelity. 25 “When you have children and grandchildren, and have grown old in the
land, should you then degrade yourselves by fashioning an idol in any form and by this evil done
in his sight provoke the LORD, your God, 26 I call heaven and earth this day to witness against
you, that you shall all quickly perish from the land which you will occupy when you cross the
Jordan. You shall not live in it for any length of time but shall be promptly wiped out. 27 The
LORD will scatter you among the nations, and there shall remain but a handful of you among the
nations to which the LORD will lead you. 28 There you shall serve gods fashioned by the hands
of man out of wood and stone, gods which can neither see nor hear, neither eat nor smell. 29 Yet
there too you shall seek the LORD, your God; and you shall indeed find him when you search
after him with your whole heart and your whole soul. 30 In your distress, when all these things
shall have come upon you, you shall finally return to the LORD, your God, and heed his voice.
31 Since the LORD, your God, is a merciful God, he will not abandon and destroy you, nor
forget the covenant which under oath he made with your fathers.
Proofs of God’s Love. 32 “Ask now of the days of old, before your time, ever since God
created man upon the earth; ask from one end of the sky to the other: Did anything so great ever
happen before? Was it ever heard of? 33 Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking from
the midst of fire, as you did, and live? 34 Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for
himself from the midst of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, with his
strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors, all of which the LORD, your God, did for
you in Egypt before your very eyes? 35 All this you were allowed to see that you might know the
LORD is God and there is no other. 36 Out of the heavens he let you hear his voice to discipline
you; on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard him speaking out of the fire. 37 For love
of your fathers he chose their descendants and personally led you out of Egypt by his great
power, 38 driving out of your way nations greater and mightier than you, so as to bring you in
and to make their land your heritage, as it is today. 39 This is why you must now know, and fix
in your heart, that the LORD is God in the heavens above and on earth below, and that there is
no other. 40 You must keep his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you today, that

you and your children after you may prosper, and that you may have long life on the land which
the LORD, your God, is giving you forever.”
Cities of Refuge. 41 Then Moses set apart three cities in the region east of the Jordan, 42
that a homicide might take refuge there if he unwittingly killed his neighbor to whom he had
previously borne no malice, and that he might save his life by fleeing to one of these cities: 43
Bezer in the desert, in the region of the plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead for the
Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassehites.
II. GOD AND HIS COVENANT
Introduction. 44 This is the law which Moses set before the Israelites. 45 These are the
ordinances, statutes and decrees which he proclaimed to them when they had come out of Egypt
46 and were beyond the Jordan in the ravine opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the
Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and whom Moses and the Israelites defeated after coming out
of Egypt. 47 They occupied his land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, as well—the land of
these two kings of the Amorites in the region east of the Jordan: 48 from Aroer on the edge of
the Wadi Arnon to Mount Sion (that is Hermon) 49 and all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far
as the Arabah Sea under the slopes of Pisgah.
Deut. 5
The Covenant at Horeb. 1 Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Hear, O Israel,
the statutes and decrees which I proclaim in your hearing this day, that you may learn them and
take care to observe them. 2 The LORD, our God, made a covenant with us at Horeb; 3 not with
our fathers did he make this covenant, but with us, all of us who are alive here this day. 4 The
LORD spoke with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire. 5 Since you were
afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain, I stood between the LORD and you at that
time, to announce to you these words of the LORD:
The Decalogue. 6 ‘I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
that place of slavery. 7 You shall not have other gods besides me. 8 You shall not carve idols for
yourselves in the shape of anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the waters
beneath the earth; 9 you shall not bow down before them or worship them. For I, the LORD,
your God, am a jealous God, inflicting punishments for their fathers’ wickedness on the children
of those who hate me, down to the third and fourth generation 10 but bestowing mercy, down to
the thousandth generation, on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments.
11 ‘You shall not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain. For the LORD will not
leave unpunished him who takes his name in vain.
12 ‘Take care to keep holy the sabbath day as the LORD, your God, commanded you. 13
Six days you may labor and do all your work; 14 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the
LORD, your God. No work may be done then, whether by you, or your son or daughter, or your
male or female slave, or your ox or ass or any of your beasts, or the alien who lives with you.
Your male and female slave should rest as you do. 15 For remember that you too were once
slaves in Egypt, and the LORD, your God, brought you from there with his strong hand and
outstretched arm. That is why the LORD, your God, has commanded you to observe the sabbath
day.
16 ‘Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD, your God, has commanded you, that
you may have a long life and prosperity in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you.
17 ‘You shall not kill.
18 ‘You shall not commit adultery.
19 ‘You shall not steal.
20 ‘You shall not bear dishonest witness against your neighbor.
Books of Moses

164

21 ‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. ‘You shall not desire your neighbor’s house or
field, nor his male or female slave, nor his ox or ass, nor anything that belongs to him.’
Moses as Mediator. 22 “These words, and nothing more, the LORD spoke with a loud
voice to your entire assembly on the mountain from the midst of the fire and the dense cloud. He
wrote them upon two tablets of stone and gave them to me. 23 But when you heard the voice
from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, you came to me in the
person of all your tribal heads and elders, 24 and said, ‘The LORD, our God, has indeed let us
see his glory and his majesty! We have heard his voice from the midst of the fire and have found
out today that a man can still live after God has spoken with him. 25 But why should we die
now? Surely this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD, our God, any
more, we shall die. 26 For what mortal has heard, as we have, the voice of the living God
speaking from the midst of fire, and survived? 27 Go closer, you, and hear all that the LORD,
our God, will say, and then tell us what the LORD, our God, tells you; we will listen and obey.’
28 “The LORD heard your words as you were speaking to me and said to me, ‘I have heard
the words these people have spoken to you, which are all well said. 29 Would that they might
always be of such a mind, to fear me and to keep all my commandments! Then they and their
descendants would prosper forever. 30 Go, tell them to return to their tents. 31 Then you wait
here near me and I will give you all the commandments, the statutes and decrees you must teach
them, that they may observe them in the land which I am giving them to possess.’
32 “Be careful, therefore, to do as the LORD, your God, has commanded you, not turning
aside to the right or to the left, 33 but following exactly the way prescribed for you by the
LORD, your God, that you may live and prosper, and may have long life in the land which you
are to occupy.
Deut. 6
1 “These then are the commandments, the statutes and decrees which the LORD, your God,
has ordered that you be taught to observe in the land into which you are crossing for conquest, 2
so that you and your son and your grandson may fear the LORD, your God, and keep, throughout
the days of your lives, all his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you, and thus have
long life. 3 Hear then, Israel, and be careful to observe them, that you may grow and prosper the
more, in keeping with the promise of the LORD, the God of your fathers, to give you a land
flowing with milk and honey.
The Great Commandment. 4 “Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone! 5
Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
with all your strength. 6 Take to heart these words which I enjoin on you today. 7 Drill them into
your children. Speak of them at home and abroad, whether you are busy or at rest. 8 Bind them at
your wrist as a sign and let them be as a pendant on your forehead. 9 Write them on the
doorposts of your houses and on your gates.
Fidelity in Prosperity. 10 “When the LORD, your God, brings you into the land which he
swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that he would give you, a land with fine, large
cities that you did not build, 11 with houses full of goods of all sorts that you did not garner, with
cisterns that you did not dig, with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant; and when,
therefore, you eat your fill, 12 take care not to forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, that place of slavery. 13 The LORD, your God, shall you fear; him shall you serve, and
by his name shall you swear. 14 You shall not follow other gods, such as those of the
surrounding nations, 15 lest the wrath of the LORD, your God, flare up against you and he
destroy you from the face of the land; for the LORD, your God, who is in your midst, is a jealous
God.
16 “You shall not put the LORD, your God, to the test, as you did at Massah. 17 But keep
the commandments of the LORD, your God, and the ordinances and statutes he has enjoined on
Books of Moses

165

you. 18 Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that you may, according to his
word, prosper, and may enter in and possess the good land which the LORD promised on oath to
your fathers, 19 thrusting all your enemies out of your way.
Instruction to Children. 20 “Later on, when your son asks you what these ordinances,
statutes and decrees mean which the LORD, our God, has enjoined on you, 21 you shall say to
your son, ‘We were once slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with
his strong hand 22 and wrought before our eyes signs and wonders, great and dire, against Egypt
and against Pharaoh and his whole house. 23 He brought us from there to lead us into the land he
promised on oath to our fathers, and to give it to us. 24 Therefore, the LORD commanded us to
observe all these statutes in fear of the LORD, our God, that we may always have as prosperous
and happy a life as we have today; 25 and our justice before the LORD, our God, is to consist in
carefully observing all these commandments he has enjoined on us.’
Deut. 7
Destruction of Pagans. 1 “When the LORD, your God, brings you into the land which you
are to enter and occupy, and dislodges great nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites,
Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites: seven nations more numerous and
powerful than you—2 and when the LORD, your God, delivers them up to you and you defeat
them, you shall doom them. Make no covenant with them and show them no mercy. 3 You shall
not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters to their sons nor taking their daughters
for your sons. 4 For they would turn your sons from following me to serving other gods, and then
the wrath of the LORD would flare up against you and quickly destroy you.
5 “But this is how you must deal with them: Tear down their altars, smash their sacred
pillars, chop down their sacred poles, and destroy their idols by fire. 6 For you are a people
sacred to the LORD, your God; he has chosen you from all the nations on the face of the earth to
be a people peculiarly his own. 7 It was not because you are the largest of all nations that the
LORD set his heart on you and chose you, for you are really the smallest of all nations. 8 It was
because the LORD loved you and because of his fidelity to the oath he had sworn to your fathers,
that he brought you out with his strong hand from the place of slavery, and ransomed you from
the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. 9 Understand, then, that the LORD, your God, is God
indeed, the faithful God who keeps his merciful covenant down to the thousandth generation
toward those who love him and keep his commandments, 10 but who repays with destruction the
person who hates him; he does not dally with such a one, but makes him personally pay for it. 11
You shall therefore carefully observe the commandments, the statutes and the decrees which I
enjoin on you today.
Blessings of Obedience. 12 “As your reward for heeding these decrees and observing them
carefully, the LORD, your God, will keep with you the merciful covenant which he promised on
oath to your fathers. 13 He will love and bless and multiply you; he will bless the fruit of your
womb and the produce of your soil, your grain and wine and oil, the issue of your herds and the
young of your flocks, in the land which he swore to your fathers he would give you. 14 You will
be blessed above all peoples; no man or woman among you shall be childless nor shall your
livestock be barren. 15 The LORD will remove all sickness from you; he will not afflict you with
any of the malignant diseases that you know from Egypt, but will leave them with all your
enemies.
16 “You shall consume all the nations which the LORD, your God, will deliver up to you.
You are not to look on them with pity, lest you be ensnared into serving their gods. 17 Perhaps
you will say to yourselves, ‘These nations are greater than we. How can we dispossess them?’ 18
But do not be afraid of them. Rather, call to mind what the LORD, your God, did to Pharaoh and
to all Egypt: 19 the great testings which your own eyes have seen, the signs and wonders, his
strong hand and outstretched arm with which the LORD, your God, brought you out. The same
Books of Moses

166

also will he do to all the nations of whom you are now afraid. 20 Moreover, the LORD, your
God, will send hornets among them, until the survivors who have hidden from you are destroyed.
21 Therefore, do not be terrified by them, for the LORD, your God, who is in your midst, is a
great and awesome God. 22 He will dislodge these nations before you little by little. You cannot
exterminate them all at once, lest the wild beasts become too numerous for you. 23 The LORD,
your God, will deliver them up to you and will rout them utterly until they are annihilated. 24 He
will deliver their kings into your hand, that you may make their names perish from under the
heavens. No man will be able to stand up against you, till you have put an end to them. 25 The
images of their gods you shall destroy by fire. Do not covet the silver or gold on them, nor take it
for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it; for it is an abomination to the LORD, your God. 26
You shall not bring any abominable thing into your house, lest you be doomed with it; loathe and
abhor it utterly as a thing that is doomed.
Deut. 8
God’s Care. 1 “Be careful to observe all the commandments I enjoin on you today, that
you may live and increase, and may enter in and possess the land which the LORD promised on
oath to your fathers. 2 Remember how for forty years now the LORD, your God, has directed all
your journeying in the desert, so as to test you by affliction and find out whether or not it was
your intention to keep his commandments. 3 He therefore let you be afflicted with hunger, and
then fed you with manna, a food unknown to you and your fathers, in order to show you that not
by bread alone does man live, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of the LORD.
4 The clothing did not fall from you in tatters, nor did your feet swell these forty years. 5 So you
must realize that the LORD, your God, disciplines you even as a man disciplines his son.
Danger of Prosperity. 6 “Therefore, keep the commandments of the LORD, your God, by
walking in his ways and fearing him. 7 For the LORD, your God, is bringing you into a good
country, a land with streams of water, with springs and fountains welling up in the hills and
valleys, 8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, of olive trees and
of honey, 9 a land where you can eat bread without stint and where you will lack nothing, a land
whose stones contain iron and in whose hills you can mine copper. 10 But when you have eaten
your fill, you must bless the LORD, your God, for the good country he has given you. 11 Be
careful not to forget the LORD, your God, by neglecting his commandments and decrees and
statutes which I enjoin on you today: 12 lest, when you have eaten your fill, and have built fine
houses and lived in them, 13 and have increased your herds and flocks, your silver and gold, and
all your property, 14 you then become haughty of heart and unmindful of the LORD, your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery; 15 who guided you through the
vast and terrible desert with its saraph serpents and scorpions, its parched and waterless ground;
who brought forth water for you from the flinty rock 16 and fed you in the desert with manna, a
food unknown to your fathers, that he might afflict you and test you, but also make you
prosperous in the end. 17 Otherwise, you might say to yourselves, ‘It is my own power and the
strength of my own hand that has obtained for me this wealth.’ 18 Remember then, it is the
LORD, your God, who gives you the power to acquire wealth, by fulfilling, as he has now done,
the covenant which he swore to your fathers. 19 But if you forget the LORD, your God, and
follow other gods, serving and worshiping them, I forewarn you this day that you will perish
utterly. 20 Like the nations which the LORD destroys before you, so shall you too perish for not
heeding the voice of the LORD, your God.
Deut. 9
Unmerited Success. 1 “Hear, O Israel! You are now about to cross the Jordan to enter in
and dispossess nations greater and stronger than yourselves, having large cities fortified to the
sky, 2 the Anakim, a people great and tall. You know of them and have heard it said of them,
Books of Moses

167

‘Who can stand up against the Anakim?’ 3 Understand, then, today that it is the LORD, your
God, who will cross over before you as a consuming fire; he it is who will reduce them to
nothing and subdue them before you, so that you can drive them out and destroy them quickly, as
the LORD promised you. 4 After the LORD, your God, has thrust them out of your way, do not
say to yourselves, ‘It is because of my merits that the LORD has brought me in to possess this
land’; for it is really because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them
out before you. 5 No, it is not because of your merits or the integrity of your heart that you are
going in to take possession of their land; but the LORD, your God, is driving these nations out
before you on account of their wickedness and in order to keep the promise which he made on
oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 6 Understand this, therefore: it is not because of
your merits that the LORD, your God, is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiffnecked people.
The Golden Calf. 7 “Bear in mind and do not forget how you angered the LORD, your
God, in the desert. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you arrived in this place, you
have been rebellious toward the LORD. 8 At Horeb you so provoked the LORD that he was
angry enough to destroy you, 9 when I had gone up the mountain to receive the stone tablets of
the covenant which the LORD made with you. Meanwhile I stayed on the mountain forty days
and forty nights without eating or drinking, 10 till the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone
inscribed, by God’s own finger, with a copy of all the words that the LORD spoke to you on the
mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. 11 Then, at the end of the forty
days and forty nights, when the LORD had given me the two stone tablets of the covenant, 12 he
said to me, ‘Go down from here now, quickly, for your people whom you have brought out of
Egypt have become depraved; they have already turned aside from the way I pointed out to them
and have made for themselves a molten idol. 13 I have seen now how stiff-necked this people is,’
the LORD said to me. 14 ‘Let me be, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under
the heavens. I will then make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’
15 “When I had come down again from the blazing, fiery mountain, with the two tablets of
the covenant in both my hands, 16 I saw how you had sinned against the LORD, your God: you
had already turned aside from the way which the LORD had pointed out to you by making for
yourselves a molten calf! 17 Raising the two tablets with both hands I threw them from me and
broke them before your eyes. 18 Then, as before, I lay prostrate before the LORD for forty days
and forty nights without eating or drinking, because of all the sin you had committed in the sight
of the LORD and the evil you had done to provoke him. 19 For I dreaded the fierce anger of the
LORD against you: his wrath would destroy you. Yet once again the LORD listened to me. 20
With Aaron, too, the LORD was deeply angry, and would have killed him had I not prayed for
him also at that time. 21 Then, taking the calf, the sinful object you had made, and fusing it with
fire, I ground it down to powder as fine as dust, which I threw into the wadi that went down the
mountainside.
22 “At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah likewise, you provoked the LORD to
anger. 23 And when he sent you up from Kadesh-barnea to take possession of the land he was
giving you, you rebelled against this command of the LORD, your God, and would not trust or
obey him. 24 Ever since I have known you, you have been rebels against the LORD.
25 “Those forty days, then, and forty nights, I lay prostrate before the LORD, because he
had threatened to destroy you. 26 This was my prayer to him: O Lord GOD, destroy not your
people, the heritage which your majesty has ransomed and brought out of Egypt with your strong
hand. 27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Look not upon the stubbornness
of this people nor upon their wickedness and sin, 28 lest the people from whose land you have
brought us say, ‘The LORD was not able to bring them into the land he promised them’; or ‘Out
of hatred for them, he brought them out to slay them in the desert.’ 29 They are, after all, your
people and your heritage, whom you have brought out by your great power and with your
Books of Moses

168

outstretched arm.
Deut. 10
1 “At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Cut two tablets of stone like the former; then come
up the mountain to me. Also make an ark of wood. 2 I will write upon the tablets the
commandments that were on the former tablets that you broke, and you shall place them in the
ark.’ 3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the former, and went up
the mountain carrying the two tablets. 4 The LORD then wrote on them, as he had written
before, the ten commandments which he spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire
on the day of the assembly. After the LORD had given them to me, 5 I turned and came down
the mountain, and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. There they have remained, in keeping
with the command the LORD gave me.
6 (The Israelites set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan for Moserah, where Aaron died and was
buried, his son Eleazar succeeding him in the priestly office. 7 From there they set out for
Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah for Jotbathah, a region where there is water in the wadies.)
8 “At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, to be in attendance before the LORD and minister to him, and to give blessings in his
name, as they have done to this day. 9 For this reason, Levi has no share in the heritage with his
brothers; the LORD himself is his heritage, as the LORD, your God, has told him.
10 “After I had spent these other forty days and forty nights on the mountain, and the LORD
had once again heard me and decided not to destroy you, 11 he said to me, ‘Go now and set out
at the head of your people, that they may enter in and occupy the land which I swore to their
fathers I would give them.’
The Lord’s Majesty. 12 “And now, Israel, what does the LORD, your God, ask of you but
to fear the LORD, your God, and follow his ways exactly, to love and serve the LORD, your
God, with all your heart and all your soul, 13 to keep the commandments and statutes of the
LORD which I enjoin on you today for your own good? 14 Think! The heavens, even the highest
heavens, belong to the LORD, your God, as well as the earth and everything on it. 15 Yet in his
love for your fathers the LORD was so attached to them as to choose you, their descendants, in
preference to all other peoples, as indeed he has now done. 16 Circumcise your hearts, therefore,
and be no longer stiff-necked. 17 For the LORD, your God, is the God of gods, the LORD of
lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who has no favorites, accepts no bribes; 18 who
executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him.
19 So you too must befriend the alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.
20 The LORD, your God, shall you fear, and him shall you serve; hold fast to him and swear by
his name. 21 He is your glory, he, your God, who has done for you those great and terrible things
which your own eyes have seen. 22 Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy strong, and now
the LORD, your God, has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.
Deut. 11
The Wonders of the Lord. 1 “Love the LORD, your God, therefore, and always heed his
charge: his statutes, decrees and commandments. 2 It is not your children, who have not known it
from experience, but you yourselves who must now understand the discipline of the LORD, your
God; his majesty, his strong hand and outstretched arm; 3 the signs and deeds he wrought among
the Egyptians, on Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and on all his land; 4 what he did to the Egyptian army
and to their horses and chariots, engulfing them in the water of the Red Sea as they pursued you,
and bringing ruin upon them even to this day; 5 what he did for you in the desert until you
arrived in this place; 6 and what he did to the Reubenites Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab,
when the ground opened its mouth and swallowed them up out of the midst of Israel, with their
families and tents and every living thing that belonged to them. 7 With your own eyes you have
Books of Moses

169

seen all these great deeds that the LORD has done. 8 Keep all the commandments, then, which I
enjoin on you today, that you may be strong enough to enter in and take possession of the land
into which you are crossing, 9 and that you may have long life on the land which the LORD
swore to your fathers he would give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and
honey.
The Gift of Rain. 10 “For the land which you are to enter and occupy is not like the land of
Egypt from which you have come, where you would sow your seed and then water it by hand, as
in a vegetable garden. 11 No, the land into which you are crossing for conquest is a land of hills
and valleys that drinks in rain from the heavens, 12 a land which the LORD, your God, looks
after; his eyes are upon it continually from the beginning of the year to the end. 13 If, then, you
truly heed my commandments which I enjoin on you today, loving and serving the LORD, your
God, with all your heart and all your soul, 14 I will give the seasonal rain to your land, the early
rain and the late rain, that you may have your grain, wine and oil to gather in; 15 and I will bring
forth grass in your fields for your animals. Thus you may eat your fill. 16 But be careful lest your
heart be so lured away that you serve other gods and worship them. 17 For then the wrath of the
LORD will flare up against you and he will close up the heavens, so that no rain will fall, and the
soil will not yield its crops, and you will soon perish from the good land he is giving you.
Reward of Fidelity. 18 “Therefore, take these words of mine into your heart and soul. Bind
them at your wrist as a sign, and let them be a pendant on your forehead. 19 Teach them to your
children, speaking of them at home and abroad, whether you are busy or at rest. 20 And write
them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates, 21 so that, as long as the heavens are
above the earth, you and your children may live on in the land which the LORD swore to your
fathers he would give them.
22 “For if you are careful to observe all these commandments I enjoin on you, loving the
LORD, your God, and following his ways exactly, and holding fast to him, 23 the LORD will
drive all these nations out of your way, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than
yourselves. 24 Every place where you set foot shall be yours: from the desert and from Lebanon,
from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea, shall be your territory. 25 None shall stand up
against you; the LORD, your God, will spread the fear and dread of you through any land where
you set foot, as he promised you.
A Blessing and a Curse. 26 “I set before you here, this day, a blessing and a curse: 27 a
blessing for obeying the commandments of the LORD, your God, which I enjoin on you today;
28 a curse if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD, your God, but turn aside from
the way I ordain for you today, to follow other gods, whom you have not known. 29 When the
LORD, your God, brings you into the land which you are to enter and occupy, then you shall
pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim, the curse on Mount Ebal. 30 (Are they not beyond the
Jordan, on the other side of the western road in the country of the Canaanites who live in the
Arabah, opposite the Gilgal beside the terebinth of Moreh?) 31 For you are about to cross the
Jordan to enter and occupy the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you. When, therefore,
you take possession of it and settle there, 32 be careful to observe all the statutes and decrees that
I set before you today.
III. EXPOSITION OF THE LAW
Deut. 12
One Sanctuary. 1 “These are the statutes and decrees which you must be careful to observe
in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to occupy, as long as you
live on its soil. 2 Destroy without fail every place on the high mountains, on the hills, and under
every leafy tree where the nations you are to dispossess worship their gods. 3 Tear down their
altars, smash their sacred pillars, destroy by fire their sacred poles, and shatter the idols of their
gods, that you may stamp out the remembrance of them in any such place.
Books of Moses

170

4 “That is not how you are to worship the LORD, your God. 5 Instead, you shall resort to
the place which the LORD, your God, chooses out of all your tribes and designates as his
dwelling 6 and there you shall bring your holocausts and sacrifices, your tithes and personal
contributions, your votive and freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks. 7
There, too, before the LORD, your God, you and your families shall eat and make merry over all
your undertakings, because the LORD, your God, has blessed you. 8 You shall not do as we are
now doing; here, everyone does what seems right to himself, 9 since you have not yet reached
your resting place, the heritage which the LORD, your God, will give you. 10 But after you have
crossed the Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you as a heritage,
when he has given you rest from all your enemies round about and you live there in security, 11
then to the place which the LORD, your God, chooses as the dwelling place for his name you
shall bring all the offerings I command you: your holocausts and sacrifices, your tithes and
personal contributions, and every special offering you have vowed to the LORD. 12 You shall
make merry before the LORD, your God, with your sons and daughters, your male and female
slaves, as well as with the Levite who belongs to your community but has no share of his own in
your heritage. 13 Take care not to offer up your holocausts in any place you fancy, 14 but offer
them up in the place which the LORD chooses from among your tribes; there you shall make
whatever offerings I enjoin upon you.
Profane & Sacred Meals. 15 “However, in any of your communities you may slaughter
and eat to your heart’s desire as much meat as the LORD, your God, has blessed you with; and
the unclean as well as the clean may eat it, as they do the gazelle or the deer. 16 Only, you shall
not partake of the blood, but must pour it out on the ground like water. 17 Moreover, you shall
not, in your own communities, partake of your tithe of grain or wine or oil, of the first-born of
your herd or flock, of any offering you have vowed, of your freewill offerings, or of your
personal contributions. 18 These you must eat before the LORD, your God, in the place he
chooses, along with your son and daughter, your male and female slave, and the Levite who
belongs to your community; and there, before the LORD, you shall make merry over all your
undertakings. 19 Take care, also, that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in the
land.
20 “After the LORD, your God, has enlarged your territory, as he promised you, when you
wish meat for food, you may eat it at will, to your heart’s desire; 21 and if the place which the
LORD, your God, chooses for the abode of his name is too far, you may slaughter in the manner
I have told you any of your herd or flock that the LORD has given you, and eat it to your heart’s
desire in your own community. 22 You may eat it as you would the gazelle or the deer: the
unclean and the clean eating it alike. 23 But make sure that you do not partake of the blood; for
blood is life, and you shall not consume this seat of life with the flesh. 24 Do not partake of the
blood, therefore, but pour it out on the ground like water. 25 Abstain from it, that you and your
children after you may prosper for doing what is right in the sight of the LORD. 26 However,
any sacred gifts or votive offerings that you may have, you shall bring with you to the place
which the LORD chooses, 27 and there you must offer both the flesh and the blood of your
holocausts on the altar of the LORD, your God; of your other sacrifices the blood indeed must be
poured out against the altar of the LORD, your God, but their flesh may be eaten. 28 Be careful
to heed all these commandments I enjoin on you, that you and your descendants may always
prosper for doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD, your God.
Pagan Rites. 29 “When the LORD, your God, removes the nations from your way as you
advance to dispossess them, be on your guard! Otherwise, once they have been wiped out before
you and you have replaced them and are settled in their land, 30 you will be lured into following
them. Do not inquire regarding their gods, ‘How did these nations worship their gods? I, too,
would do the same.’ 31 You shall not thus worship the LORD, your God, because they offered to
their gods every abomination that the LORD detests, even burning their sons and daughters to
Books of Moses

171

their gods.
Deut. 13
Penalities for Idolatry. 1 “Every command that I enjoin on you, you shall be careful to
observe, neither adding to it nor subtracting from it.
2 “If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer who promises you a sign or wonder, 3
urging you to follow other gods, whom you have not known, and to serve them: even though the
sign or wonder he has foretold you comes to pass, 4 pay no attention to the words of that prophet
or that dreamer; for the LORD, your God, is testing you to learn whether you really love him
with all your heart and with all your soul. 5 The LORD, your God, shall you follow, and him
shall you fear; his commandment shall you observe, and his voice shall you heed, serving him
and holding fast to him alone. 6 But that prophet or that dreamer shall be put to death, because,
in order to lead you astray from the way which the LORD, your God, has directed you to take, he
has preached apostasy from the LORD, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and
ransomed you from that place of slavery. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.
7 “If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or your intimate
friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, 8
gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: 9 do
not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, 10 but kill
him. Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.
11 You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the LORD, your
God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery. 12 And all Israel, hearing
of it, shall fear and never again do such evil as this in your midst.
13 “If, in any of the cities which the LORD, your God, gives you to dwell in, you hear it
said 14 that certain scoundrels have sprung up among you and have led astray the inhabitants of
their city to serve other gods whom you have not known, 15 you must inquire carefully into the
matter and investigate it thoroughly. If you find that it is true and an established fact that this
abomination has been committed in your midst, 16 you shall put the inhabitants of that city to the
sword, dooming the city and all life that is in it, even its cattle, to the sword. 17 Having heaped
up all its spoils in the middle of its square, you shall burn the city with all its spoils as a whole
burnt offering to the LORD, your God. Let it be a heap of ruins forever, never to be rebuilt. 18
You shall not retain anything that is doomed, that the blazing wrath of the LORD may die down
and he may show you mercy and in his mercy for you may multiply you as he promised your
fathers on oath; 19 because you have heeded the voice of the LORD, your God, keeping all his
commandments which I enjoin on you today, doing what is right in his sight.
Deut. 14
Pagan Mourning Rites. 1 “You are children of the LORD, your God. You shall not gash
yourselves nor shave the hair above your foreheads for the dead. 2 For you are a people sacred to
the LORD, your God, who has chosen you from all the nations on the face of the earth to be a
people peculiarly his own.
Clean and Unclean Animals. 3 “You shall not eat any abominable thing. 4 These are the
animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 5 the red deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the
ibex, the addax, the oryx, and the mountain sheep. 6 Any animal that has hoofs you may eat,
provided it is cloven-footed and chews the cud. 7 But you shall not eat any of the following that
only chew the cud or only have cloven hoofs: the camel, the hare and the rock badger, which
indeed chew the cud, but do not have hoofs and are therefore unclean for you; 8 and the pig,
which indeed has hoofs and is cloven-footed, but does not chew the cud and is therefore unclean
for you. Their flesh you shall not eat, and their dead bodies you shall not touch.
9 “Of the various creatures that live in the water, whatever has both fins and scales you may
Books of Moses

172

eat, 10 but all those that lack either fins or scales you shall not eat; they are unclean for you.
11 “You may eat all clean birds. 12 But you shall not eat any of the following: the eagle, the
vulture, the osprey, 13 the various kites and falcons, 14 all the various species of crows, 15 the
ostrich, the nightjar, the gull, the various species of hawks, 16 the owl, the screech owl, the ibis,
17 the desert owl, the buzzard, the cormorant, 18 the stork, the various species of herons, the
hoopoe, and the bat. 19 All winged insects, too, are unclean for you and shall not be eaten. 20
But you may eat any clean winged creatures.
21 “You must not eat any animal that has died of itself, for you are a people sacred to the
LORD, your God. But you may give it to an alien who belongs to your community, and he may
eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner.
“You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
Tithes. 22 “Each year you shall tithe all the produce that grows in the field you have sown;
23 then in the place which the LORD, your God, chooses as the dwelling place of his name you
shall eat in his presence your tithe of the grain, wine and oil, as well as the firstlings of your herd
and flock, that you may learn always to fear the LORD, your God. 24 If, however, the journey is
too much for you and you are not able to bring your tithe, because the place which the LORD,
your God, chooses for the abode of his name is too far for you, considering how the LORD has
blessed you, 25 you may exchange the tithe for money and, with the purse of money in hand, go
to the place which the LORD, your God, chooses. 26 You may then exchange the money for
whatever you desire, oxen or sheep, wine or strong drink, or anything else you would enjoy, and
there before the LORD, your God, you shall partake of it and make merry with your family. 27
But do not neglect the Levite who belongs to your community, for he has no share in the heritage
with you.
28 “At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithes of your produce for that
year and deposit them in community stores, 29 that the Levite who has no share in the heritage
with you, and also the alien, the orphan and the widow who belong to your community, may
come and eat their fill; so that the LORD, your God, may bless you in all that you undertake.
Deut. 15
Debts and the Poor. 1 “At the end of every seven-year period you shall have a relaxation
of debts, 2 which shall be observed as follows. Every creditor shall relax his claim on what he
has loaned his neighbor; he must not press his neighbor, his kinsman, because a relaxation in
honor of the LORD has been proclaimed. 3 You may press a foreigner, but you shall relax the
claim on your kinsman for what is yours. 4 Nay, more! since the LORD, your God, will bless
you abundantly in the land he will give you to occupy as your heritage, there should be no one of
you in need. 5 If you but heed the voice of the LORD, your God, and carefully observe all these
commandments which I enjoin on you today, 6 you will lend to many nations, and borrow from
none; you will rule over many nations, and none will rule over you, since the LORD, your God,
will bless you as he promised. 7 If one of your kinsmen in any community is in need in the land
which the LORD, your God, is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor close your hand
to him in his need. 8 Instead, you shall open your hand to him and freely lend him enough to
meet his need. 9 Be on your guard lest, entertaining the mean thought that the seventh year, the
year of relaxation, is near, you grudge help to your needy kinsman and give him nothing; else he
will cry to the LORD against you and you will be held guilty. 10 When you give to him, give
freely and not with ill will; for the LORD, your God, will bless you for this in all your works and
undertakings. 11 The needy will never be lacking in the land; that is why I command you to open
your hand to your poor and needy kinsman in your country.
Hebrew Slaves. 12 “If your kinsman, a Hebrew man or woman, sells himself to you, he is
to serve you for six years, but in the seventh year you shall dismiss him from your service, a free
man. 13 When you do so, you shall not send him away empty-handed, 14 but shall weight him
Books of Moses

173

down with gifts from your flock and threshing floor and wine press, in proportion to the blessing
the LORD, your God, has bestowed on you. 15 For remember that you too were once slaves in
the land of Egypt, and the LORD, your God, ransomed you. That is why I am giving you this
command today. 16 If, however, he tells you that he does not wish to leave you, because he is
devoted to you and your household, since he fares well with you, 17 you shall take an awl and
thrust it through his ear into the door, and he shall then be your slave forever. Your female slave,
also, you shall treat in the same way. 18 You must not be reluctant to let your slave go free, since
the service he has given you for six years was worth twice a hired man’s salary; then also the
LORD, your God, will bless you in everything you do.
Firstlings. 19 “You shall consecrate to the LORD, your God, all the male firstlings of your
herd and of your flock. You shall not work the firstlings of your cattle, nor shear the firstlings of
your flock. 20 Year after year you and your family shall eat them before the LORD, your God, in
the place he chooses. 21 If, however, a firstling is lame or blind or has any other serious defect,
you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD, your God, 22 but in your own communities you may eat
it, the unclean and the clean eating it alike, as you would a gazelle or a deer. 23 Only, you shall
not partake of its blood, which must be poured out on the ground like water.
Deut. 16
Feast of the Passover. 1 “Observe the month of Abib by keeping the Passover of the
LORD, your God, since it was in the month of Abib that he brought you by night out of Egypt. 2
You shall offer the Passover sacrifice from your flock or your herd to the LORD, your God, in
the place which he chooses as the dwelling place of his name. 3 You shall not eat leavened bread
with it. For seven days you shall eat with it only unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, that
you may remember as long as you live the day of your departure from the land of Egypt; for in
frightened haste you left the land of Egypt. 4 Nothing leavened may be found in all your territory
for seven days, and none of the meat which you sacrificed on the evening of the first day shall be
kept overnight for the next day.
5 “You may not sacrifice the Passover in any of the communities which the LORD, your
God, gives you; 6 only at the place which he chooses as the dwelling place of his name, and in
the evening at sunset, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt, shall you sacrifice the
Passover. 7 You shall cook and eat it at the place the LORD, your God, chooses; then in the
morning you may return to your tents. 8 For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the
seventh there shall be a solemn meeting in honor of the LORD, your God; on that day you shall
not do any sort of work.
Feast of Weeks. 9 “You shall count off seven weeks, computing them from the day when
the sickle is first put to the standing grain. 10 You shall then keep the feast of Weeks in honor of
the LORD, your God, and the measure of your own freewill offering shall be in proportion to the
blessing the LORD, your God, has bestowed on you. 11 In the place which the LORD, your God,
chooses as the dwelling place of his name, you shall make merry in his presence together with
your son and daughter, your male and female slave, and the Levite who belongs to your
community, as well as the alien, the orphan and the widow among you. 12 Remember that you
too were once slaves in Egypt, and carry out these statutes carefully.
Feast of Booths. 13 “You shall celebrate the feast of Booths for seven days, when you have
gathered in the produce from your threshing floor and wine press. 14 You shall make merry at
your feast, together with your son and daughter, your male and female slave, and also the Levite,
the alien, the orphan and the widow who belong to your community. 15 For seven days you shall
celebrate this pilgrim feast in honor of the LORD, your God, in the place which he chooses;
since the LORD, your God, has blessed you in all your crops and in all your undertakings, you
shall do nought but make merry.
16 “Three times a year, then, every male among you shall appear before the LORD, your
Books of Moses

174

God, in the place which he chooses: at the feast of Unleavened Bread, at the feast of Weeks, and
at the feast of Booths. No one shall appear before the LORD empty-handed, 17 but each of you
with as much as he can give, in proportion to the blessings which the LORD, your God, has
bestowed on you.
Judges. 18 “You shall appoint judges and officials throughout your tribes to administer true
justice for the people in all the communities which the LORD, your God, is giving you. 19 You
shall not distort justice; you must be impartial. You shall not take a bribe; for a bribe blinds the
eyes even of the wise and twists the words even of the just. 20 Justice and justice alone shall be
your aim, that you may have life and may possess the land which the LORD, your God, is giving
you.
Pagan Worship. 21 “You shall not plant a sacred pole of any kind of wood beside the altar
of the LORD, your God, which you will build; 22 nor shall you erect a sacred pillar, such as the
LORD, your God, detests.
Deut. 17
1 “You shall not sacrifice to the LORD, your God, from the herd or from the flock an animal
with any serious defect; that would be an abomination to the LORD, your God.
2 “If there is found among you, in any one of the communities which the LORD, your God,
gives you, a man or a woman who does evil in the sight of the LORD, your God, and
transgresses his covenant, 3 by serving other gods, or by worshiping the sun or the moon or any
of the host of the sky, against my command; 4 and if, on being informed of it, you find by careful
investigation that it is true and an established fact that this abomination has been committed in
Israel: 5 you shall bring the man (or woman) who has done the evil deed out to your city gates
and stone him to death. 6 The testimony of two or three witnesses is required for putting a person
to death; no one shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 7 At the execution,
the witnesses are to be the first to raise their hands against him; afterward all the people are to
join in. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.
Judges. 8 “If in your own community there is a case at issue which proves too complicated
for you to decide, in a matter of bloodshed or of civil rights or of personal injury, you shall then
go up to the place which the LORD, your God, chooses, 9 to the levitical priests or to the judge
who is in office at that time. They shall study the case and then hand down to you their decision.
10 According to this decision that they give you in the place which the LORD chooses, you shall
act, being careful to do exactly as they direct. 11 You shall carry out the directions they give you
and the verdict they pronounce for you, without turning aside to the right or to the left from the
decision they hand down to you. 12 Any man who has the insolence to refuse to listen to the
priest who officiates there in the ministry of the LORD, your God, or to the judge, shall die. Thus
shall you purge the evil from your midst. 13 And all the people, on hearing of it, shall fear, and
never again be so insolent.
The King. 14 “When you have come into the land which the LORD, your God, is giving
you, and have occupied it and settled in it, should you then decide to have a king over you like
all the surrounding nations, 15 you shall set that man over you as your king whom the LORD,
your God, chooses. He whom you set over you as king must be your kinsman; a foreigner, who
is no kin of yours, you may not set over you. 16 But he shall not have a great number of horses;
nor shall he make his people go back again to Egypt to acquire them, against the LORD’S
warning that you must never go back that way again. 17 Neither shall he have a great number of
wives, lest his heart be estranged, nor shall he accumulate a vast amount of silver and gold. 18
When he is enthroned in his kingdom, he shall have a copy of this law made from the scroll that
is in the custody of the levitical priests. 19 He shall keep it with him and read it all the days of
his life that he may learn to fear the LORD, his God, and to heed and fulfill all the words of this
law and these statutes. 20 Let him not become estranged from his countrymen through pride, nor
Books of Moses

175

turn aside to the right or to the left from these commandments. Then he and his descendants will
enjoy a long reign in Israel.
Deut. 18
Priests. 1 “The whole priestly tribe of Levi shall have no share in the heritage with Israel;
they shall live on the oblations of the LORD and the portions due to him. 2 Levi shall have no
heritage among his brothers; the LORD himself is his heritage, as he has told him. 3 The priests
shall have a right to the following things from the people: from those who are offering a
sacrifice, whether the victim is from the herd or from the flock, the priest shall receive the
shoulder, the jowls and the stomach. 4 You shall also give him the first fruits of your grain and
wine and oil, as well as the first fruits of the shearing of your flock; 5 for the LORD, your God,
has chosen him and his sons out of all your tribes to be always in attendance to minister in the
name of the LORD.
6 “When a Levite goes from one of your communities anywhere in Israel in which he
ordinarily resides, to visit, as his heart may desire, the place which the LORD chooses, 7 he may
minister there in the name of the LORD, his God, like all his fellow Levites who are in
attendance there before the LORD. 8 He shall then receive the same portions to eat as the rest,
along with his monetary offerings and heirlooms.
Prophets. 9 “When you come into the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you, you
shall not learn to imitate the abominations of the peoples there. 10 Let there not be found among
you anyone who immolates his son or daughter in the fire, nor a fortune-teller, soothsayer,
charmer, diviner, 11 or caster of spells, nor one who consults ghosts and spirits or seeks oracles
from the dead. 12 Anyone who does such things is an abomination to the LORD, and because of
such abominations the LORD, your God, is driving these nations out of your way. 13 You,
however, must be altogether sincere toward the LORD, your God. 14 Though these nations
whom you are to dispossess listen to their soothsayers and fortune-tellers, the LORD, your God,
will not permit you to do so.
15 “A prophet like me will the LORD, your God, raise up for you from among your own
kinsmen; to him you shall listen. 16 This is exactly what you requested of the LORD, your God,
at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, ‘Let us not again hear the voice of the
LORD, our God, nor see this great fire any more, lest we die.’ 17 And the LORD said to me,
‘This was well said. 18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kinsmen,
and will put my words into his mouth; he shall tell them all that I command him. 19 If any man
will not listen to my words which he speaks in my name, I myself will make him answer for it.
20 But if a prophet presumes to speak in my name an oracle that I have not commanded him to
speak, or speaks in the name of other gods, he shall die.’
21 “If you say to yourselves, ‘How can we recognize an oracle which the LORD has
spoken?’, 22 know that, even though a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if his oracle is
not fulfilled or verified, it is an oracle which the LORD did not speak. The prophet has spoken it
presumptuously, and you shall have no fear of him.
Deut. 19
Cities of Refuge. 1 “When the LORD, your God, removes the nations whose land he is
giving you, and you have taken their place and are settled in their cities and houses, 2 you shall
set apart three cities in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you to occupy. 3 You shall
thereby divide into three regions the land which the LORD, your God, will give you as a
heritage, and so arrange the routes that every homicide will be able to find a refuge.
4 “It is in the following case that a homicide may take refuge in such a place to save his life:
when someone unwittingly kills his neighbor to whom he had previously borne no malice. 5 For
example, if he goes with his neighbor to a forest to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a
Books of Moses

176

tree, its head flies off the handle and hits his neighbor a mortal blow, he may take refuge in one
of these cities to save his life. 6 Should the distance be too great, the avenger of blood may in the
heat of his anger pursue the homicide and overtake him and strike him dead, even though he does
not merit death since he had previously borne the slain man no malice. 7 That is why I order you
to set apart three cities.
8 “But if the LORD, your God, enlarges your territory, as he swore to your fathers, and
gives you all the land he promised your fathers he would give 9 in the event that you carefully
observe all these commandments which I enjoin on you today, loving the LORD, your God, and
ever walking in his ways: then add three cities to these three. 10 Thus, in the land which the
LORD, your God, is giving you as a heritage, innocent blood will not be shed and you will not
become guilty of bloodshed.
11 “However, if someone lies in wait for his neighbor out of hatred for him, and rising up
against him, strikes him mortally, and then takes refuge in one of these cities, 12 the elders of his
own city shall send for him and have him taken from there, and shall hand him over to be slain
by the avenger of blood. 13 Do not look on him with pity, but purge from Israel the stain of
shedding innocent blood, that you may prosper.
Removal of Landmarks. 14 “You shall not move your neighbor’s landmarks erected by
your forefathers in the heritage you receive in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you
to occupy.
False Witnesses. 15 “One witness alone shall not take the stand against a man in regard to
any crime or any offense of which he may be guilty; a judicial fact shall be established only on
the testimony of two or three witnesses.
16 “If an unjust witness takes the stand against a man to accuse him of a defection from the
law, 17 the two parties in the dispute shall appear before the LORD in the presence of the priests
or judges in office at that time; 18 and if after a thorough investigation the judges find that the
witness is a false witness and has accused his kinsman falsely, 19 you shall do to him as he
planned to do to his kinsman. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst. 20 The rest, on
hearing of it, shall fear, and never again do a thing so evil among you. 21 Do not look on such a
man with pity. Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot!
Deut. 20
Courage in War. 1 “When you go out to war against your enemies and you see horses and
chariots and an army greater than your own, do not be afraid of them, for the LORD, your God,
who brought you up from the land of Egypt, will be with you.
2 “When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and say to the
soldiers: 3 ‘Hear, O Israel! Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Be not
weakhearted or afraid; be neither alarmed nor frightened by them. 4 For it is the LORD, your
God, who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies and give you victory.’
5 “Then the officials shall say to the soldiers, ‘Is there anyone who has built a new house
and not yet had the housewarming? Let him return home, lest he die in battle and another
dedicate it. 6 Is there anyone who has planted a vineyard and never yet enjoyed its fruits? Let
him return home, lest he die in battle and another enjoy its fruits in his stead. 7 Is there anyone
who has betrothed a woman and not yet taken her as his wife? Let him return home, lest he die in
battle and another take her to wife.’ 8 In fine, the officials shall say to the soldiers, ‘Is there
anyone who is afraid and weakhearted? Let him return home, lest he make his fellows as
fainthearted as himself.’
9 “When the officials have finished speaking to the soldiers, military officers shall be
appointed over the army.
Cities of the Enemy. 10 “When you march up to attack a city, first offer it terms of peace.
11 If it agrees to your terms of peace and opens its gates to you, all the people to be found in it
Books of Moses

177

shall serve you in forced labor. 12 But if it refuses to make peace with you and instead offers you
battle, lay siege to it, 13 and when the LORD, your God, delivers it into your hand, put every
male in it to the sword; 14 but the women and children and livestock and all else in it that is
worth plundering you may take as your booty, and you may use this plunder of your enemies
which the LORD, your God, has given you.
15 “That is how you shall deal with any city at a considerable distance from you, which does
not belong to the peoples of this land. 16 But in the cities of those nations which the LORD, your
God, is giving you as your heritage, you shall not leave a single soul alive. 17 You must doom
them all - the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites - as the LORD,
your God, has commanded you, 18 lest they teach you to make any such abominable offerings as
they make to their gods, and you thus sin against the LORD, your God.
Trees of a Besieged City. 19 “When you are at war with a city and have to lay siege to it for
a long time before you capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them. You
may eat their fruit, but you must not cut down the trees. After all, are the trees of the field men,
that they should be included in your siege? 20 However, those trees which you know are not fruit
trees you may destroy, cutting them down to build siegeworks with which to reduce the city that
is resisting you.
Deut. 21
Expiation of Untraced Murder. 1 “If the corpse of a slain man is found lying in the open
on the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you to occupy, and it is not known who killed
him, 2 your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distances to the cities that are in the
neighborhood of the corpse. 3 When it is established which city is nearest the corpse, the elders
of that city shall take a heifer that has never been put to work as a draft animal under a yoke, 4
and bringing it down to a wadi with an everflowing stream at a place that has not been plowed or
sown, they shall cut the heifer’s throat there in the wadi. 5 The priests, the descendants of Levi,
shall also be present, for the LORD, your God, has chosen them to minister to him and to give
blessings in his name, and every case of dispute or violence must be settled by their decision. 6
Then all the elders of that city nearest the corpse shall wash their hands over the heifer whose
throat was cut in the wadi, 7 and shall declare, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, and our eyes
did not see the deed. 8 Absolve, O LORD, your people Israel, whom you have ransomed, and let
not the guilt of shedding innocent blood remain in the midst of your people Israel.’ Thus they
shall be absolved from the guilt of bloodshed, 9 and you shall purge from your midst the guilt of
innocent blood, that you may prosper for doing what is right in the sight of the LORD.
Marriage with a Female Captive. 10 “When you go out to war against your enemies and
the LORD, your God, delivers them into your hand, so that you take captives, 11 if you see a
comely woman among the captives and become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as
wife, 12 you may take her home to your house. But before she may live there, she must shave her
head and pare her nails 13 and lay aside her captive’s garb. After she has mourned her father and
mother for a full month, you may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she
shall be your wife. 14 However, if later on you lose your liking for her, you shall give her her
freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not sell her or enslave her, since she was married to you
under compulsion.
Rights of the First-born. 15 “If a man with two wives loves one and dislikes the other; and
if both bear him sons, but the first-born is of her whom he dislikes: 16 when he comes to
bequeath his property to his sons he may not consider as his first-born the son of the wife he
loves, in preference to his true first-born, the son of the wife whom he dislikes. 17 On the
contrary, he shall recognize as his first-born the son of her whom he dislikes, giving him a
double share of whatever he happens to own, since he is the first fruits of his manhood, and to
him belong the rights of the first-born.
Books of Moses

178

The Incorrigible Son. 18 “If a man has a stubborn and unruly son who will not listen to his
father or mother, and will not obey them even though they chastise him, 19 his father and mother
shall have him apprehended and brought out to the elders at the gate of his home city, 20 where
they shall say to those city elders, ‘This son of ours is a stubborn and unruly fellow who will not
listen to us; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 21 Then all his fellow citizens shall stone him to
death. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel, on hearing of it, shall fear.
Corspe of a Criminal. 22 “If a man guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his corpse
hung on a tree, 23 it shall not remain on the tree overnight. You shall bury it the same day;
otherwise, since God’s curse rests on him who hangs on a tree, you will defile the land which the
LORD, your God, is giving you as an inheritance.
Deut. 22
Care for Lost Animals. 1 “You shall not see your kinsman’s ox or sheep driven astray
without showing concern about it; see to it that it is returned to your kinsman. 2 If this kinsman
does not live near you, or you do not know who he may be, take it to your own place and keep it
with you until he claims it; then give it back to him. 3 You shall do the same with his ass, or his
garment, or anything else which your kinsman loses and you happen to find; you may not be
unconcerned about them. 4 You shall not see your kinsman’s ass or ox foundering on the road
without showing concern about it; see to it that you help him lift it up.
Various Precepts. 5 “A woman shall not wear an article proper to a man, nor shall a man
put on a woman’s dress; for anyone who does such things is an abomination to the LORD, your
God.
6 “If, while walking along, you chance upon a bird’s nest with young birds or eggs in it, in
any tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting on them, you shall not take away the
mother bird along with her brood; 7 you shall let her go, although you may take her brood away.
It is thus that you shall have prosperity and a long life.
8 “When you build a new house, put a parapet around the roof; otherwise, if someone falls
off, you will bring bloodguilt upon your house.
9 “You shall not sow your vineyard with two different kinds of seed; if you do, its produce
shall become forfeit, both the crop you have sown and the yield of the vineyard. 10 You shall not
plow with an ox and an ass harnessed together. 11 You shall not wear cloth of two different
kinds of thread, wool and linen, woven together.
12 “You shall put twisted cords on the four corners of the cloak that you wrap around you.
Crimes Against Marriage. 13 “If a man, after marrying a woman and having relations
with her, comes to dislike her, 14 and makes monstrous charges against her and defames her by
saying, ‘I married this woman, but when I first had relations with her I did not find her a virgin,’
15 the father and mother of the girl shall take the evidence of her virginity and bring it to the
elders at the city gate. 16 There the father of the girl shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter
to this man in marriage, but he has come to dislike her, 17 and now brings monstrous charges
against her, saying: I did not find your daughter a virgin. But here is the evidence of my
daughter’s virginity!’ And they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the city. 18 Then
these city elders shall take the man and chastise him, 19 besides fining him one hundred silver
shekels, which they shall give to the girl’s father, because the man defamed a virgin in Israel.
Moreover, she shall remain his wife, and he may not divorce her as long as he lives.
20 “But if this charge is true, and evidence of the girl’s virginity is not found, 21 they shall
bring the girl to the entrance of her father’s house and there her townsmen shall stone her to
death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father’s house.
Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.
22 “If a man is discovered having relations with a woman who is married to another, both
the man and the woman with whom he has had relations shall die. Thus shall you purge the evil
Books of Moses

179

from your midst.
23 “If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with
her, 24 you shall bring them both out to the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl
because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated
his neighbor’s wife. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.
25 “If, however, it is in the open fields that a man comes upon such a betrothed maiden,
seizes her and has relations with her, the man alone shall die. 26 You shall do nothing to the
maiden, since she is not guilty of a capital offense. This case is like that of a man who rises up
against his neighbor and murders him: 27 it was in the open fields that he came upon her, and
though the betrothed maiden may have cried out for help, there was no one to come to her aid.
28 “If a man comes upon a maiden that is not betrothed, takes her and has relations with her,
and their deed is discovered, 29 the man who had relations with her shall pay the girl’s father
fifty silver shekels and take her as his wife, because he has deflowered her. Moreover, he may
not divorce her as long as he lives.
Deut. 23
1 “A man shall not marry his father’s wife, nor shall he dishonor his father’s bed.
Membership in the Community. 2 “No one whose testicles have been crushed or whose
penis has been cut off may be admitted into the community of the LORD. 3 No child of an
incestuous union may be admitted into the community of the LORD, nor any descendant of his
even to the tenth generation. 4 No Ammonite or Moabite may ever be admitted into the
community of the LORD, nor any descendants of theirs even to the tenth generation, 5 because
they would not succor you with food and water on your journey after you left Egypt, and because
Moab hired Balaam, son of Beor, from Pethor in Aram Naharaim, to curse you; 6 though the
LORD, your God, would not listen to Balaam and turned his curse into a blessing for you,
because he loves you. 7 Never promote their peace and prosperity as long as you live. 8 But do
not abhor the Edomite, since he is your brother, nor the Egyptian, since you were an alien in his
country. 9 Children born to them may in the third generation be admitted into the community of
the LORD.
Cleanliness in Camp. 10 “When you are in camp during an expedition against your
enemies, you shall keep yourselves from everything offensive. 11 If one of you becomes unclean
because of a nocturnal emission, he shall go outside the camp, and not return until, 12 toward
evening, he has bathed in water; then, when the sun has set, he may come back into the camp. 13
Outside the camp you shall have a place set aside to be used as a latrine. 14 You shall also keep a
trowel in your equipment and with it, when you go outside to ease nature, you shall first dig a
hole and afterward cover up your excrement. 15 Since the LORD, your God, journeys along
within your camp to defend you and to put your enemies at your mercy, your camp must be holy;
otherwise, if he sees anything indecent in your midst, he will leave your company.
Various Precepts. 16 “You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has taken refuge
from him with you. 17 Let him live with you wherever he chooses, in any one of your
communities that pleases him. Do not molest him.
18 “There shall be no temple harlot among the Israelite women, nor a temple prostitute
among the Israelite men. 19 You shall not offer a harlot’s fee or a dog’s price as any kind of
votive offering in the house of the LORD, your God; both these things are an abomination to the
LORD, your God.
20 “You shall not demand interest from your countrymen on a loan of money or of food or
of anything else on which interest is usually demanded. 21 You may demand interest from a
foreigner, but not from your countryman, so that the LORD, your God, may bless you in all your
undertakings on the land you are to enter and occupy.
22 “When you make a vow to the LORD, your God, you shall not delay in fulfilling it;
Books of Moses

180

otherwise you will be held guilty, for the LORD, your God, is strict in requiring it of you. 23
Should you refrain from making a vow, you will not be held guilty. 24 But you must keep your
solemn word and fulfill the votive offering you have freely promised to the LORD.
25 “When you go through your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat as many of his grapes as
you wish, but do not put them in your basket. 26 When you go through your neighbor’s
grainfield, you may pluck some of the ears with your hand, but do not put a sickle to your
neighbor’s grain.
Deut. 24
Marriage Laws. 1 “When a man, after marrying a woman and having relations with her, is
later displeased with her because he finds in her something indecent, and therefore he writes out
a bill of divorce and hands it to her, thus dismissing her from his house: 2 if on leaving his house
she goes and becomes the wife of another man, 3 and the second husband, too, comes to dislike
her and dismisses her from his house by handing her a written bill of divorce; or if this second
man who has married her, dies; 4 then her former husband, who dismissed her, may not again
take her as his wife after she has become defiled. That would be an abomination before the
LORD, and you shall not bring such guilt upon the land which the LORD, your God, is giving
you as a heritage.
5 “When a man is newly wed, he need not go out on a military expedition, nor shall any
public duty be imposed on him. He shall be exempt for one year for the sake of his family, to
bring joy to the wife he has married.
Justice, Equity and Charity. 6 “No one shall take a hand mill or even its upper stone as a
pledge for debt, for he would be taking the debtor’s sustenance as a pledge.
7 “If any man is caught kidnaping a fellow Israelite in order to enslave him and sell him, the
kidnaper shall be put to death. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.
8 “In an attack of leprosy you shall be careful to observe exactly and to carry out all the
directions of the levitical priests. Take care to act in accordance with the instructions I have
given them. 9 Remember what the LORD, your God, did to Miriam on the journey after you left
Egypt.
10 “When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor, you shall not enter his house to
receive a pledge from him, 11 but shall wait outside until the man to whom you are making the
loan brings his pledge outside to you. 12 If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep in the mantle he
gives as a pledge, 13 but shall return it to him at sunset that he himself may sleep in it. Then he
will bless you, and it will be a good deed of yours before the LORD, your God.
14 “You shall not defraud a poor and needy hired servant, whether he be one of your own
countrymen or one of the aliens who live in your communities. 15 You shall pay him each day’s
wages before sundown on the day itself, since he is poor and looks forward to them. Otherwise
he will cry to the LORD against you, and you will be held guilty.
16 “Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers; only for
his own guilt shall a man be put to death.
17 “You shall not violate the rights of the alien or of the orphan, nor take the clothing of a
widow as a pledge. 18 For, remember, you were once slaves in Egypt, and the LORD, your God,
ransomed you from there; that is why I command you to observe this rule.
19 “When you reap the harvest in your field and overlook a sheaf there, you shall not go
back to get it; let it be for the alien, the orphan or the widow, that the LORD, your God, may
bless you in all your undertakings. 20 When you knock down the fruit of your olive trees, you
shall not go over the branches a second time; let what remains be for the alien, the orphan and
the widow. 21 When you pick your grapes, you shall not go over the vineyard a second time; let
what remains be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow. 22 For remember that you were once
slaves in Egypt; that is why I command you to observe this rule.
Books of Moses

181

Deut. 25
1 “When men have a dispute and bring it to court, and a decision is handed down to them
acquitting the innocent party and condemning the guilty party, 2 if the latter deserves stripes, the
judge shall have him lie down and in his presence receive the number of stripes his guilt
deserves. 3 Forty stripes may be given him, but no more; lest, if he were beaten with more stripes
than these, your kinsman should be looked upon as disgraced because of the severity of the
beating.
4 “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out grain.
Levirate Marriage. 5 “When brothers live together and one of them dies without a son, the
widow of the deceased shall not marry anyone outside the family; but her husband’s brother shall
go to her and perform the duty of a brother-in-law by marrying her. 6 The first-born son she
bears shall continue the line of the deceased brother, that his name may not be blotted out from
Israel. 7 If, however, a man does not care to marry his brother’s wife, she shall go up to the
elders at the gate and declare, ‘My brother-in-law does not intend to perform his duty toward me
and refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel.’ 8 Thereupon the elders of his city shall
summon him and admonish him. If he persists in saying, ‘I am not willing to marry her,’ 9 his
sister-in-law, in the presence of the elders, shall go up to him and strip his sandal from his foot
and spit in his face, saying publicly, ‘This is how one should be treated who will not build up his
brother’s family!’ 10 And his lineage shall be spoken of in Israel as ‘the family of the man
stripped of his sandal.’
Various Precepts. 11 “When two men are fighting and the wife of one intervenes to save
her husband from the blows of his opponent, if she stretches out her hand and seizes the latter by
his private parts, 12 you shall chop off her hand without pity.
13 “You shall not keep two differing weights in your bag, one large and the other small; 14
nor shall you keep two different measures in your house, one large and the other small. 15 But
use a true and just weight, and a true and just measure, that you may have a long life on the land
which the LORD, your God, is giving you. 16 Everyone who is dishonest in any of these matters
is an abomination to the LORD, your God.
17 “Bear in mind what Amalek did to you on the journey after you left Egypt, 18 how
without fear of any god he harassed you along the way, weak and weary as you were, and cut off
at the rear all those who lagged behind. 19 Therefore, when the LORD, your God, gives you rest
from all your enemies round about in the land which he is giving you to occupy as your heritage,
you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens. Do not forget!
Deut. 26
Thanksgiving for the Harvest. 1 “When you have come into the land which the LORD,
your God, is giving you as a heritage, and have occupied it and settled in it, 2 you shall take
some first fruits of the various products of the soil which you harvest from the land which the
LORD, your God, gives you, and putting them in a basket, you shall go to the place which the
LORD, your God, chooses for the dwelling place of his name. 3 There you shall go to the priest
in office at that time and say to him, ‘Today I acknowledge to the LORD, my God, that I have
indeed come into the land which he swore to our fathers he would give us.’ 4 The priest shall
then receive the basket from you and shall set it in front of the altar of the LORD, your God. 5
Then you shall declare before the LORD, your God, ‘My father was a wandering Aramean who
went down to Egypt with a small household and lived there as an alien. But there he became a
nation great, strong and numerous. 6 When the Egyptians maltreated and oppressed us, imposing
hard labor upon us, 7 we cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers, and he heard our cry and
saw our affliction, our toil and our oppression. 8 He brought us out of Egypt with his strong hand
and outstretched arm, with terrifying power, with signs and wonders; 9 and bringing us into this
country, he gave us this land flowing with milk and honey. 10 Therefore, I have now brought
Books of Moses

182

you the first fruits of the products of the soil which you, O LORD, have given me.’ And having
set them before the LORD, your God, you shall bow down in his presence. 11 Then you and
your family, together with the Levite and the aliens who live among you, shall make merry over
all these good things which the LORD, your God, has given you.
Prayer with the Tithes. 12 “When you have finished setting aside all the tithes of your
produce in the third year, the year of the tithes, and you have given them to the Levite, the alien,
the orphan and the widow, that they may eat their fill in your own community, 13 you shall
declare before the LORD, your God, ‘I have purged my house of the sacred portion and I have
given it to the Levite, the alien, the orphan and the widow, just as you have commanded me. In
this I have not broken or forgotten any of your commandments: 14 I have not eaten any of the
tithe as a mourner; I have not brought any of it out as one unclean; I have not offered any of it to
the dead. I have thus hearkened to the voice of the LORD, my God, doing just as you have
commanded me. 15 Look down, then, from heaven, your holy abode, and bless your people
Israel and the soil you have given us in the land flowing with milk and honey which you
promised on oath to our fathers.’
The Lord’s Covenant. 16 “This day the LORD, your God, commands you to observe these
statutes and decrees. Be careful, then, to observe them with all your heart and with all your soul.
17 Today you are making this agreement with the LORD: he is to be your God and you are to
walk in his ways and observe his statutes, commandments and decrees, and to hearken to his
voice. 18 And today the LORD is making this agreement with you: you are to be a people
peculiarly his own, as he promised you; and provided you keep all his commandments, 19 he
will then raise you high in praise and renown and glory above all other nations he has made, and
you will be a people sacred to the LORD, your God, as he promised.”
IV. FINAL WORDS OF MOSES
Deut. 27
Ceremonies. 1 Then Moses, with the elders of Israel, gave the people this order: “Keep all
these commandments which I enjoin on you today. 2 On the day you cross the Jordan into the
land which the LORD, your God, is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with
plaster. 3 Also write on them, at the time you cross, all the words of this law, that you may thus
enter into the land flowing with milk and honey, which the LORD, your God, and the God of
your fathers, is giving you as he promised you. 4 When, moreover, you have crossed the Jordan,
besides setting up on Mount Ebal these stones concerning which I command you today, and
coating them with plaster, 5 you shall also build to the LORD, your God, an altar made of stones
that no iron tool has touched. 6 You shall make this altar of the LORD, your God, with
undressed stones, and shall offer on it holocausts to the LORD, your God. 7 You shall also
sacrifice peace offerings and eat them there, making merry before the LORD, your God. 8 On
the stones you shall inscribe all the words of this law very clearly.”
9 Moses, with the levitical priests, then said to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This
day you have become the people of the LORD, your God. 10 You shall therefore hearken to the
voice of the LORD, your God, and keep his commandments and statutes which I enjoin on you
today.”
11 That same day Moses gave the people this order: 12 “When you cross the Jordan,
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin shall stand on Mount Gerizim to pronounce
blessings over the people, 13 while Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali shall stand
on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses.
The Twelve Curses. 14 “The Levites shall proclaim aloud to all the men of Israel: 15
‘Cursed be the man who makes a carved or molten idol—an abomination to the LORD, the
product of a craftsman’s hands—and sets it up in secret!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
Books of Moses

183

16 ‘Cursed be he who dishonors his father or his mother!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
17 ‘Cursed be he who moves his neighbor’s landmarks!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
18 ‘Cursed be he who misleads a blind man on his way!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
19 ‘Cursed be he who violates the rights of the alien, the orphan or the widow!’ And all the
people shall answer, ‘Amen!’
20 ‘Cursed be he who has relations with his father’s wife, for he dishonors his father’s bed!’
And all the people shall answer, ‘Amen!’
21 ‘Cursed be he who has relations with any animal!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
22 ‘Cursed be he who has relations with his sister or his half-sister!’ And all the people shall
answer, ‘Amen!’
23 ‘Cursed be he who has relations with his mother-in-law!’ And all the people shall
answer, ‘Amen!’
24 ‘Cursed be he who slays his neighbor in secret!’ And all the people shall answer,
‘Amen!’
25 ‘Cursed be he who accepts payment for slaying an innocent man!’ And all the people
shall answer, ‘Amen!’
26 ‘Cursed be he who fails to fulfill any of the provisions of this law!’ And all the people
shall answer, ‘Amen!’
Deut. 28
Blessings for Obedience. 1 “Thus, then, shall it be: if you continue to heed the voice of the
LORD, your God, and are careful to observe all his commandments which I enjoin on you today,
the LORD, your God, will raise you high above all the nations of the earth. 2 When you hearken
to the voice of the LORD, your God, all these blessings will come upon you and overwhelm you:
3 “May you be blessed in the city, and blessed in the country! 4 “Blessed be the fruit of your
womb, the produce of your soil and the offspring of your livestock, the issue of your herds and
the young of your flocks! 5 “Blessed be your grain bin and your kneading bowl! 6 “May you be
blessed in your coming in, and blessed in your going out!
Victory & Prosperity. 7 “The LORD will beat down before you the enemies that rise up
against you; though they come out against you from but one direction, they will flee before you
in seven. 8 The LORD will affirm his blessing upon you, on your barns and on all your
undertakings, blessing you in the land that the LORD, your God, gives you. 9 Provided that you
keep the commandments of the LORD, your God, and walk in his ways, he will establish you as
a people sacred to himself, as he swore to you; 10 so that, when all the nations of the earth see
you bearing the name of the LORD, they will stand in awe of you. 11 The LORD will increase in
more than goodly measure the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the
produce of your soil, in the land which he swore to your fathers he would give you. 12 The
LORD will open up for you his rich treasure house of the heavens, to give your land rain in due
season, blessing all your undertakings, so that you will lend to many nations and borrow from
none. 13 The LORD will make you the head, not the tail, and you will always mount higher and
not decline, as long as you obey the commandments of the LORD, your God, which I order you
today to observe carefully; 14 not turning aside to the right or to the left from any of the
commandments which I now give you, in order to follow other gods and serve them.
Curses for Disobedience. 15 “But if you do not hearken to the voice of the LORD, your
God, and are not careful to observe all his commandments which I enjoin on you today, all these
curses shall come upon you and overwhelm you: 16 “May you be cursed in the city, and cursed
Books of Moses

184

in the country! 17 “Cursed be your grain bin and your kneading bowl! 18 “Cursed be the fruit of
your womb, the produce of your soil and the offspring of your livestock, the issue of your herds
and the young of your flocks! 19 “May you be cursed in your coming in, and cursed in your
going out!
Sickness & Defeat. 20 “The LORD will put a curse on you, defeat and frustration in every
enterprise you undertake, until you are speedily destroyed and perish for the evil you have done
in forsaking me. 21 The LORD will bring a pestilence upon you that will persist until he has
exterminated you from the land you are entering to occupy. 22 The LORD will strike you with
wasting and fever, with scorching, fiery drought, with blight and searing wind, that will plague
you until you perish. 23 The sky over your heads will be like bronze and the earth under your
feet like iron. 24 For rain the LORD will give your land powdery dust, which will come down
upon you from the sky until you are destroyed. 25 The LORD will let you be beaten down before
your enemies; though you advance against them from one direction, you will flee before them in
seven, so that you will become a terrifying example to all the kingdoms of the earth. 26 Your
carcasses will become food for all the birds of the air and for the beasts of the field, with no one
to frighten them off. 27 The LORD will strike you with Egyptian boils and with tumors, eczema
and the itch, until you cannot be cured. 28 And the LORD will strike you with madness,
blindness and panic, 29 so that even at midday you will grope like a blind man in the dark,
unable to find your way.
Dispoilment. “You will be oppressed and robbed continually, with no one to come to your
aid. 30 Though you betroth a wife, another man will have her. Though you build a house, you
will not live in it. Though you plant a vineyard, you will not enjoy its fruits. 31 Your ox will be
slaughtered before your eyes, and you will not eat of its flesh. Your ass will be stolen in your
presence, but you will not recover it. Your flocks will be given to your enemies, with no one to
come to your aid. 32 Your sons and daughters will be given to a foreign nation while you look on
and grieve for them in constant helplessness. 33 A people whom you do not know will consume
the fruit of your soil and of all your labor, and you will be oppressed and crushed at all times
without surcease, 34 until you are driven mad by what your eyes must look upon. 35 The LORD
will strike you with malignant boils of which you cannot be cured, on your knees and legs, and
from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head.
Exile. 36 “The LORD will bring you, and your king whom you have set over you, to a
nation which you and your fathers have not known, and there you will serve strange gods of
wood and stone, 37 and will call forth amazement, reproach and barbed scorn from all the
nations to which the LORD will lead you.
Fruitless Labors. 38 “Though you spend much seed on your field, you will harvest but
little, for the locusts will devour the crop. 39 Though you plant and cultivate vineyards, you will
not drink or store up the wine, for the grubs will eat the vines clean. 40 Though you have olive
trees throughout your country, you will have no oil for ointment, for your olives will drop off
unripe. 41 Though you beget sons and daughters, they will not remain with you, but will go into
captivity. 42 Buzzing insects will infest all your trees and the crops of your soil. 43 The alien
residing among you will rise higher and higher above you, while you sink lower and lower. 44
He will lend to you, not you to him. He will become the head, you the tail.
45 “All these curses will come upon you, pursuing you and overwhelming you, until you are
destroyed, because you would not hearken to the voice of the LORD, your God, nor keep the
commandments and statutes he gave you. 46 They will light on you and your descendants as a
sign and a wonder for all time. 47 Since you would not serve the LORD, your God, with joy and
gratitude for abundance of every kind, 48 therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and utter
poverty, you will serve the enemies whom the LORD will send against you. He will put an iron
yoke on your neck, until he destroys you.
Invasion and Siege. 49 “The LORD will raise up against you a nation from afar, from the
Books of Moses

185

end of the earth, that swoops down like an eagle, a nation whose tongue you do not understand,
50 a nation of stern visage, that shows neither respect for the aged nor pity for the young. 51
They will consume the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your soil, until you are
destroyed; they will leave you no grain or wine or oil, no issue of your herds or young of your
flocks, until they have brought about your ruin. 52 They will besiege you in each of your
communities, until the great, unscalable walls you trust in come tumbling down all over your
land. They will so besiege you in every community throughout the land which the LORD, your
God, has given you, 53 that in the distress of the siege to which your enemy subjects you, you
will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your own sons and daughters whom the LORD, your
God, has given you. 54 The most refined and fastidious man among you will begrudge his
brother and his beloved wife and his surviving children, 55 any share in the flesh of his children
that he himself is using for food when nothing else is left him in the straits of the siege to which
your enemy will subject you in all your communities. 56 The most refined and delicate woman
among you, so delicate and refined that she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the
ground, will begrudge her beloved husband and her son and daughter 57 the afterbirth that issues
from her womb and the infant she brings forth when she secretly uses them for food for want of
anything else, in the straits of the siege to which your enemy will subject you in your
communities.
Plagues. 58 “If you are not careful to observe every word of the law which is written in this
book, and to revere the glorious and awesome name of the LORD, your God, 59 he will smite
you and your descendants with severe and constant blows, malignant and lasting maladies. 60 He
will again afflict you with all the diseases of Egypt which you dread, and they will persist among
you. 61 Should there be any kind of sickness or calamity not mentioned in this book of the law,
that too the LORD will bring upon you until you are destroyed. 62 Of you who were numerous
as the stars in the sky, only a few will be left, because you would not hearken to the voice of the
LORD, your God.
Exile. 63 “Just as the LORD once took delight in making you grow and prosper, so will he
now take delight in ruining and destroying you, and you will be plucked out of the land you are
now entering to occupy. 64 The LORD will scatter you among all the nations from one end of
the earth to the other, and there you will serve strange gods of wood and stone, such as you and
your fathers have not known. 65 Among these nations you will find no repose, not a foot of
ground to stand upon, for there the LORD will give you an anguished heart and wasted eyes and
a dismayed spirit. 66 You will live in constant suspense and stand in dread both day and night,
never sure of your existence. 67 In the morning you will say, ‘Would that it were evening!’ and
in the evening you will say, ‘Would that it were morning!’ for the dread that your heart must feel
and the sight that your eyes must see. 68 The LORD will send you back in galleys to Egypt, to
the region I told you that you were never to see again; and there you will offer yourselves for
sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.”
69 These are the words of the covenant which the LORD ordered Moses to make with the
Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which he made with them at Horeb.
Deut. 29
Past Favors Recalled. 1 Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen all
that the LORD did in the land of Egypt before your very eyes to Pharaoh and all his servants and
to all his land; 2 the great testings your own eyes have seen, and those great signs and wonders. 3
But not even at the present day has the LORD yet given you a mind to understand, or eyes to see,
or ears to hear. 4 ‘I led you for forty years in the desert. Your clothes did not fall from you in
tatters nor your sandals from your feet; 5 bread was not your food, nor wine or beer your drink.
Thus you should know that I, the LORD, am your God.’ 6 When we came to this place, Sihon,
king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, came out to engage us in battle, but we defeated them
Books of Moses

186

7 and took over their land, which we then gave as a heritage to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half
the tribe of Manasseh. 8 Keep the terms of this covenant, therefore, and fulfill them, that you
may succeed in whatever you do.
All Israel Bound by the Covenant. 9 “You are all now standing before the LORD, your
God—your chiefs and judges, your elders and officials, and all of the men of Israel, 10 together
with your wives and children and the aliens who live in your camp, down to those who hew
wood and draw water for you—11 that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD, your God,
which he concluded with you today under this sanction of a curse; 12 so that he may now
establish you as his people and he may be your God, as he promised you and as he swore to your
fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 13 But it is not with you alone that I am making this covenant,
under this sanction of a curse; 14 it is just as much with those who are not here among us today
as it is with those of us who are now here present before the LORD, our God.
Warning Against Idolatry. 15 “You know in what surroundings we lived in the land of
Egypt and what we passed by in the nations we traversed, 16 and you saw the loathsome idols of
wood and stone, of gold and silver, that they possess. 17 Let there be, then, no man or woman,
no clan or tribe among you, who would now turn away their hearts from the LORD, our God, to
go and serve these pagan gods! Let there be no root that would bear such poison and wormwood
among you. 18 If any such person, upon hearing the words of this curse, should beguile himself
into thinking that he can safely persist in his stubbornness of heart, as though to sweep away both
the watered soil and the parched ground, 19 the LORD will never consent to pardon him.
Instead, the LORD’S wrath and jealousy will flare up against that man, and every curse
mentioned in this book will alight on him. The LORD will blot out his name from under the
heavens 20 and will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for doom, in keeping with all the
curses of the covenant inscribed in this book of the law.
Punishment for Infidelity. 21 “Future generations, your own descendants who will rise up
after you, as well as the foreigners who will come here from far-off lands, when they see the
calamities of this land and the ills with which the LORD has smitten it—22 all its soil being
nothing but sulphur and salt, a burnt-out waste, unsown and unfruitful, without a blade of grass,
destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in his
furious wrath—23 they and all the nations will ask, ‘Why has the LORD dealt thus with this
land? Why this fierce outburst of wrath?’ 24 And the answer will be, ‘Because they forsook the
covenant which the LORD, the God of their fathers, had made with them when he brought them
out of the land of Egypt, 25 and they went and served other gods and adored them, gods whom
they did not know and whom he had not let fall to their lot: 26 that is why the LORD was angry
with this land and brought on it all the imprecations listed in this book; 27 in his furious wrath
and tremendous anger the LORD uprooted them from their soil and cast them out into a strange
land, where they are today.’ 28 (Both what is still hidden and what has already been revealed
concern us and our descendants forever, that we may carry out all the words of this law.)
Deut. 30
Mercy for the Repentant. 1 “When all these things which I have set before you, the
blessings and the curses, are fulfilled in you, and from among whatever nations the LORD, your
God, may have dispersed you, you ponder them in your heart: 2 then, provided that you and your
children return to the LORD, your God, and heed his voice with all your heart and all your soul,
just as I now command you, 3 the LORD, your God, will change your lot; and taking pity on
you, he will again gather you from all the nations wherein he has scattered you. 4 Though you
may have been driven to the farthest corner of the world, even from there will the LORD, your
God, gather you; even from there will he bring you back. 5 The LORD, your God, will then
bring you into the land which your fathers once occupied, that you too may occupy it, and he will
make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers. 6 The LORD, your God, will
Books of Moses

187

circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, that you may love the LORD, your
God, with all your heart and all your soul, and so may live. 7 But all those curses the LORD,
your God, will assign to your enemies and the foes who persecuted you. 8 You, however, must
again heed the LORD’S voice and carry out all his commandments which I now enjoin on you. 9
Then the LORD, your God, will increase in more than goodly measure the returns from all your
labors, the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your soil; for
the LORD, your God, will again take delight in your prosperity, even as he took delight in your
fathers’, 10 if only you heed the voice of the LORD, your God, and keep his commandments and
statutes that are written in this book of the law, when you return to the LORD, your God, with all
your heart and all your soul.
God’s Command is Clear. 11 “For this command which I enjoin on you today is not too
mysterious and remote for you. 12 It is not up in the sky, that you should say, ‘Who will go up in
the sky to get it for us and tell us of it, that we may carry it out?’ 13 Nor is it across the sea, that
you should say, ‘Who will cross the sea to get it for us and tell us of it, that we may carry it out?’
14 No, it is something very near to you, already in your mouths and in your hearts; you have
only to carry it out.
The Choice Before Israel. 15 “Here, then, I have today set before you life and prosperity,
death and doom. 16 If you obey the commandments of the LORD, your God, which I enjoin on
you today, loving him, and walking in his ways, and keeping his commandments, statutes and
decrees, you will live and grow numerous, and the LORD, your God, will bless you in the land
you are entering to occupy. 17 If, however, you turn away your hearts and will not listen, but are
led astray and adore and serve other gods, 18 I tell you now that you will certainly perish; you
will not have a long life on the land which you are crossing the Jordan to enter and occupy. 19 I
call heaven and earth today to witness against you: I have set before you life and death, the
blessing and the curse. Choose life, then, that you and your descendants may live, 20 by loving
the LORD, your God, heeding his voice, and holding fast to him. For that will mean life for you,
a long life for you to live on the land which the LORD swore he would give to your fathers
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”
Deut. 31
The Lord’s Leadership. 1 When Moses had finished speaking these words to all Israel, 2
he said to them, “I am now one hundred and twenty years old and am no longer able to move
about freely; besides, the LORD has told me that I shall not cross this Jordan. 3 It is the LORD,
your God, who will cross before you; he will destroy these nations before you, that you may
supplant them. (It is Joshua who will cross before you, as the LORD promised.) 4 The LORD
will deal with them just as he dealt with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites whom he
destroyed, and with their country. 5 When, therefore, the LORD delivers them up to you, you
must deal with them exactly as I have ordered you. 6 Be brave and steadfast; have no fear or
dread of them, for it is the LORD, your God, who marches with you; he will never fail you or
forsake you.”
Call of Joshua. 7 Then Moses summoned Joshua and in the presence of all Israel said to
him, “Be brave and steadfast, for you must being this people into the land which the LORD
swore to their fathers he would give them; you must put them in possession of their heritage. 8 It
is the LORD who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you or forsake
you. So do not fear or be dismayed.”
The Reading of the Law. 9 When Moses had written down this law, he entrusted it to the
levitical priests who carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel, 10
giving them this order: “On the feast of Booths, at the prescribed time in the year of relaxation
which comes at the end of every seven-year period, 11 when all Israel goes to appear before the
LORD, your God, in the place which he chooses, you shall read this law aloud in the presence of
Books of Moses

188

all Israel. 12 Assemble the people—men, women and children, as well as the aliens who live in
your communities—that they may hear it and learn it, and so fear the LORD, your God, and
carefully observe all the words of this law. 13 Their children also, who do not know it yet, must
hear it and learn it, that they too may fear the LORD, your God, as long as you live on the land
which you will cross the Jordan to occupy.”
Commission of Joshua. 14 The LORD said to Moses, “The time is now approaching for
you to die. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves at the meeting tent that I may give him his
commission.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the meeting tent. 15 And
the LORD appeared at the tent in a column of cloud, which stood still at the entrance of the tent.
A Command to Moses. 16 The LORD said to Moses, “Soon you will be at rest with your
fathers, and then this people will take to rendering wanton worship to the strange gods among
whom they will live in the land they are about to enter. They will forsake me and break the
covenant which I have made with them. 17 At that time my anger will flare up against them; I
will forsake them and hide my face from them, so that they will become a prey to be devoured,
and many evils and troubles will befall them. At that time they will indeed say, ‘Is it not because
our God is not among us that these evils have befallen us?’ 18 Yet I will be hiding my face from
them at that time only because of all the evil they have done in turning to other gods. 19 Write
out this song, then, for yourselves. Teach it to the Israelites and have them recite it, so that this
song may be a witness for me against the Israelites. 20 For when I have brought them into the
land flowing with milk and honey which I promised on oath to their fathers, and they have eaten
their fill and grown fat, if they turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my
covenant; 21 then, when many evils and troubles befall them, this song, which their descendants
will not have forgotten to recite, will bear witness against them. For I know what they are
inclined to do even at the present time, before I have brought them into the land which I
promised on oath to their fathers.” 22 So Moses wrote this song that same day, and he taught it to
the Israelites.
Commission of Joshua. 23 Then the LORD commissioned Joshua, son of Nun, and said to
him, “Be brave and steadfast, for it is you who must bring the Israelites into the land which I
promised them on oath. I myself will be with you.”
The Law Placed in the Ark. 24 When Moses had finished writing out on a scroll the words
of the law in their entirety, 25 he gave the Levites who carry the ark of the covenant of the
LORD this order: 26 “Take this scroll of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, your God, that there it may be a witness against you. 27 For I already know how
rebellious and stiff-necked you will be. Why, even now, while I am alive among you, you have
been rebels against the LORD! How much more, then, after I am dead! 28 Therefore, assemble
all your tribal elders and your officials before me, that I may speak these words for them to hear,
and so may call heaven and earth to witness against them. 29 For I know that after my death you
are sure to become corrupt and to turn aside from the way along which I directed you, so that evil
will befall you in some future age because you have done evil in the LORD’S sight, and
provoked him by your deeds.”
The Song of Moses. 30 Then Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end,
for the whole assembly of Israel to hear:
Deut. 32
A
1 Give ear, O heavens, while I speak; let the earth hearken to the words of my mouth!
2 May my instruction soak in like the rain, and my discourse permeate like the dew,
Like a downpour upon the grass, like a shower upon the crops.
3 For I will sing the LORD’S renown.
Oh, proclaim the greatness of our God!
Books of Moses

189

4 The Rock—how faultless are his deeds, how right all his ways!
A faithful God, without deceit, how just and upright he is!
5 Yet basely has he been treated by his degenerate children, a perverse and crooked race!
6 Is the LORD to be thus repaid by you, O stupid and foolish people?
Is he not your father who created you?
Has he not made you and established you?
7 Think back on the days of old, reflect on the years of age upon age.
Ask your father and he will inform you, ask your elders and they will tell you:
8 When the Most High assigned the nations their heritage, when he parceled out the descendants
of Adam,
He set up the boundaries of the peoples after the number of the sons of God;
9 While the LORD’S own portion was Jacob,
His hereditary share was Israel.
10 He found them in a wilderness, a wasteland of howling desert.
He shielded them and cared for them, guarding them as the apple of his eye.
11 As an eagle incites its nestlings forth by hovering over its brood,
So he spread his wings to receive them and bore them up on his pinions.
12 The LORD alone was their leader, no strange god was with him.
13 He had them ride triumphant over the summits of the land and live off the products of its
fields,
Giving them honey to suck from its rocks and olive oil from its hard, stony ground;
14 Butter from its cows and milk from its sheep, with the fat of its lambs and rams;
Its Bashan bulls and its goats, with the cream of its finest wheat; and the foaming blood of its
grapes you drank.
B
15 (So Jacob ate his fill,) the darling grew fat and frisky; you became fat and gross and gorged.
They spurned the God who made them and scorned their saving Rock.
16 They provoked him with strange gods and angered him with abominable idols.
17 They offered sacrifice to demons, to “no-gods,” to gods whom they had not known before,
To newcomers just arrived, of whom their fathers had never stood in awe.
18 You were unmindful of the Rock that begot you,
You forgot the God who gave you birth.
19 When the LORD saw this, he was filled with loathing and anger toward his sons and
daughters.
20 ‘I will hide my face from them,” he said, “and see what will then become of them.
What a fickle race they are, sons with no loyalty in them!
21 “Since they have provoked me with their ‘no-god’ and angered me with their vain idols,
I will provoke them with a ‘no-people’; with a foolish nation I will anger them.
22 “For by my wrath a fire is enkindled that shall rage to the depths of the nether world,
Consuming the earth with its yield, and licking with flames the roots of the mountains.
23 I will spend on them woe upon woe and exhaust all my arrows against them:
24 “Emaciating hunger and consuming fever and bitter pestilence,
And the teeth of wild beasts I will send among them, with the venom of reptiles gliding in the
dust.
25 “Snatched away by the sword in the street and by sheer terror at home
Shall be the youth and the maiden alike, the nursing babe as well as the hoary old man.
26 “I would have said, ‘I will make an end of them and blot out their name from men’s
memories,’
27 Had I not feared the insolence of their enemies, feared that these foes would mistakenly boast,
‘Our own hand won the victory; the LORD had nothing to do with it.’”
Books of Moses

190

28 For they are a people devoid of reason, having no understanding.
29 If they had insight they would realize what happened, they would understand their future and
say,
C
30 “How could one man rout a thousand, or two men put ten thousand to flight,
Unless it was because their Rock sold them and the LORD delivered them up?”
31 Indeed, their “rock” is not like our Rock, and our foes are under condemnation.
32 They are a branch of Sodom’s vinestock, from the vineyards of Gomorrah. Poisonous are
their grapes and bitter their clusters.
33 Their wine is the venom of dragons and the cruel poison of cobras.
34 “Is not this preserved in my treasury, sealed up in my storehouse,
35 Against the day of vengeance and requital, against the time they lose their footing?”
Close at hand is the day of their disaster and their doom is rushing upon them!
36 Surely, the LORD shall do justice for his people; on his servants he shall have pity.
When he sees their strength failing, and their protected and unprotected alike disappearing,
37 He will say, “Where are their gods whom they relied on as their ‘rock’?
38 Let those who ate the fat of your sacrifices and drank the wine of your libations
Rise up now and help you! Let them be your protection!
39 “Learn then that I, I alone, am God, and there is no god besides me.
It is I who bring both death and life, I who inflict wounds and heal them, and from my hand there
is no rescue.
40 “To the heavens I raise my hand and swear:
As surely as I live forever,
41 I will sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand shall lay hold of my quiver.
“With vengeance I will repay my foes and requite those who hate me.
42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall gorge itself with flesh—
With the blood of the slain and the captured,
Flesh from the heads of the enemy leaders.”
43 Exult with him, you heavens, glorify him, all you angels of God;
For he avenges the blood of his servants and purges his people’s land.
44 So Moses, together with Joshua, son of Nun, went and recited all the words of this song
for the people to hear.
Final Appeal. 45 When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 46 he
said, “Take to heart all the warning which I have now given you and which you must impress on
your children, that you may carry out carefully every word of this law. 47 For this is no trivial
matter for you; rather, it means your very life, since it is by this means that you are to enjoy a
long life on the land which you will cross the Jordan to occupy.”
Moses to View Canaan. 48 On that very day the LORD said to Moses, 49 “Go up on
Mount Nebo, here in the Abarim Mountains (it is in the land of Moab facing Jericho), and view
the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as their possession. 50 Then you shall die
on the mountain you have climbed, and shall be taken to your people, just as your brother Aaron
died on Mount Hor and there was taken to his people; 51 because both of you broke faith with
me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the desert of Zin by failing to
manifest my sanctity among the Israelites. 52 You may indeed view the land at a distance, but
you shall not enter that land which I am giving to the Israelites.”
Deut. 33
1 This is the blessing which Moses, the man of God, pronounced upon the Israelites before
he died. 2 He said: “The LORD came from Sinai and dawned on his people from Seir; He shone
forth from Mount Paran and advanced from Meribath-kadesh, While at his right hand a fire
Books of Moses

191

blazed forth and his wrath devastated the nations. 3 But all his holy ones were in his hand; they
followed at his feet and he bore them up on his pinions. 4 A law he gave to us; he made the
community of Jacob his domain, 5 and he became king of his darling. When the chiefs of the
people assembled and the tribes of Israel came together.
6 “May Reuben live and not die out, but let his men be few.”
7 The following is for Judah. He said: “The LORD hears the cry of Judah; you will bring him to
his people. His own hands defend his cause and you will be his help against his foes.”
8 Of Levi he said: “To Levi belong your Thummim, to the man of your favor your Urim; For you
put him to the test at Massah and you contended with him at the waters of Meribah. 9 He said of
his father, ‘I regard him not’; his brothers he would not acknowledge, and his own children he
refused to recognize. Thus the Levites keep your words, and your covenant they uphold. 10 They
promulgate your decisions to Jacob and your law to Israel. They bring the smoke of sacrifice to
your nostrils, and burnt offerings to your altar. 11 Bless, O LORD, his possessions
and accept the ministry of his hands. Break the backs of his adversaries and of his foes, that they
may not rise.”
12 Of Benjamin he said: “Benjamin is the beloved of the LORD, who shelters him all the day,
while he abides securely at his breast.”
13 Of Joseph he said: “Blessed by the LORD is his land with the best of the skies above and of
the abyss crouching beneath; 14 With the best of the produce of the year, and the choicest
sheaves of the months; 15 With the finest gifts of the age-old mountains and the best from the
timeless hills; 16 With the best of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of him who dwells in
the bush. These shall come upon the head of Joseph and upon the brow of the prince among his
brothers, 17 The majestic bull, his father’s first-born, whose horns are those of the wild ox
With which to gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth.” (These are the myriads of
Ephraim, and these the thousands of Manasseh.)
18 Of Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your pursuits, and you, Issachar, in your tents!
19 You who invite the tribes to the mountains where feasts are duly held, Because you suck up
the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.”
20 Of Gad he said: “Blessed be he who has made Gad so vast! He lies there like a lion that has
seized the arm and head of the prey. 21 He saw that the best should be his when the princely
portion was assigned, while the heads of the people were gathered. He carried out the justice of
the LORD and his decrees respecting Israel.”
22 Of Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s whelp, that springs forth from Bashan!”
23 Of Naphtali he said: “Naphtali is enriched with favors and filled with the blessings of the
LORD; The lake and south of it are his possession!”
24 Of Asher he said: “More blessed than the other sons be Asher! May he be the favorite among
his brothers, as the oil of his olive trees runs over his feet! 25 May your bolts be of iron and
bronze; may your strength endure through all your days!”
26 “There is no god like the God of the darling, who rides the heavens in his power, and rides the
skies in his majesty; 27 He spread out the primeval tent; he extended the ancient canopy. He
drove the enemy out of your way and the Amorite he destroyed. 28 Israel has dwelt securely, and
the fountain of Jacob has been undisturbed In a land of grain and wine, where the heavens drip
Books of Moses

192

with dew. 29 How fortunate you are, O Israel! Where else is a nation victorious in the LORD?
The LORD is your saving shield, and his sword is your glory. Your enemies fawn upon you,
as you stride upon their heights.”
Deut. 34
1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the headland of Pisgah
which faces Jericho, and the LORD showed him all the land - Gilead, and as far as Dan, 2 all
Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, 3
the Negeb, the circuit of the Jordan with the lowlands at Jericho, city of palms, and as far as
Zoar. 4 The LORD then said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob that I would give to their descendants. I have let you feast your eyes upon it, but you shall
not cross over.” 5 So there, in the land of Moab, Moses, the servant of the LORD, died as the
LORD had said; 6 and he was buried in the ravine opposite Beth-peor in the land of Moab, but to
this day no one knows the place of his burial. 7 Moses was one hundred and twenty years old
when he died, yet his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated. 8 For thirty days the
Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab, till they had completed the period of grief and
mourning for Moses.
9 Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom, since Moses had laid his
hands upon him; and so the Israelites gave him their obedience, thus carrying out the LORD’S
command to Moses.
10 Since then no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to
face. 11 He had no equal in all the signs and wonders the LORD sent him to perform in the land
of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land, 12 and for the might and
the terrifying power that Moses exhibited in the sight of all Israel.
